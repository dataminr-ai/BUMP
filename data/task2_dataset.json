The Dutch-led team this week also found personal possessions including jewellery after the plane was downed by a suspected Russian-made BUK missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew on July 17, 2014. In all, 16 containers of fragments of the Malaysia Airlines plane were filled so far this week. Dutch and Malaysian investigators and local authorities examine debris at the MH17 plane crash site . Chilling: MailOnline's photographer spotted the burned and torn passport of loving wife and mother Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, one of the 298 slaughtered when MH17 was downed over Ukraine on July 17, 2014. Her family in Kuala Lumpur has given MailOnline permission to publish the picture . The investigators searched for body parts and debris at a location that was previously considered unsafe . The finds came several days after MailOnline revealed how possibly key evidence and personal possessions were left lying in fields so long after a crash which shocked the world. MailOnline also found a charred passport of a Malaysian mother killed in the horror. Relatives of Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, whose husband and son were also killed, called for urgent action to clear the site, return items to bereaved families and bring those responsible for the carnage to justice. 'It broke my heart to see the picture, her passport still in the debris of the plane,' said her brother Clement, 47, in Kuala Lumpur. 'But thank you so much for finding it and telling us about it.' Also spotted at the site by MailOnline were a bracelet made of beads, a pair of sunglasses, ripped clothing and random pages from guidebooks in a reminder that many of the murdered passengers were heading to Kuala Lumpur on holiday. Investigators have renewed their search for body parts and debris in eastern Ukraine this week . A vehicle carries away debris from the site of the plane crash near the village of Grabove, in self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic . Many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - were visible among MH17's burned remains. Investigators say they were prevented from working properly in the locations where MH17 hit the ground due to fierce fighting between pro-Moscow rebels and Ukrainian military forces. The new finds of human remains were collected this week by the Dutch - working with Malaysian, Australian and Ukrainian colleagues - at a site previously inaccessible to the investigators, it was revealed. Head of the Dutch recovery mission Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said: 'More remains have been found in both parts of the so-called \"burn sites.\"' Jean Fransman, spokesman for the Dutch Department of Justice, added: 'The mission was again able to recover human remains and personal effects at two sites.' A statement said that 'personal effects were given to the members of the mission by the local population - it was jewellery'. An investigator wheels away parts of debris from the site of the plane crash in eastern Ukraine . Grim: Alongside Mabel's passport, many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - are visible among MH17's charred detritus . Haunting: Personal belongings of victims are still littered around the field - and possibly crucial evidence -because the crash scene hasn't been cleared nine months after the Malaysian Airways flight came down . A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash . The latest search operation had resumed yesterday after being halted for winter, and centred around the Petropavlivka, some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) west of Grabove and Granovo where most of the debris fell. A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash. Officials of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic were also at the site during the search which will last several weeks subject to a ceasefire holding in the region. 'A group of Dutch and Malaysian experts is working in the DPR,' said Aleksey Kostrubitskiy, local emergencies minister. 'Today 10 per cent of the area - two places where fragments had fallen and there was fire - was worked over. 'Sixteen containers of fragments have been loaded. 'Units of the [DPR] emergencies ministry will go there every day and 10 staffers of the emergencies ministry will be involved.' The Dutch-led team was forced to leave the crash site in August amid shooting close to the crash site. Souvenir: A shot glass bought as a reminder of what should have been a jovial trip lies on the ground . A sign indicating the entrance to the site in eastern Ukraine is forbidden is displayed as Dutch and Malaysian investigators search for debris . The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands . A week long recovery operation in November was delayed by fighting between separatists and Ukrainian troops. Representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have also faced acute problems accessing the crash site to secure key evidence. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site. The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands. Forensic experts in the Dutch city of Hilversum have identified bodies of 296 victims of the crash. Two victims - both from the Netherlands - remain unidentified. The probe team is due to issue its report into the crash later this year. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode. 'Probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a BUK missile, but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter.' The dead from MH17 comprised 192 Dutch citizens (one also had U.S. citizenship), 44 Malaysians, including the 15 crew members, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, ten Britons (one also had South African citizenship), four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander.", "reference_summary": "Investigators have found more body parts from where MH17 fell in Ukraine .

Some apparently healthy meals are worse for you than demonised junk foods from the likes of McDonald’s, Burger King and Pizza Express, researchers have found . For example, Asda’s Piri Piri Chicken Pasta Salad contains 46.5g of fat – two thirds of the recommended daily intake for an adult – which is more than the 43.3g found in a Burger King Bacon and Cheese Whopper. Meanwhile a Marks & Spencer Chicken and Smoked Bacon Salad sandwich contains 694 calories and 37.1g of fat – but a Pizza Express Classic Margherita pizza has 683 calories and contains only 22.5g of fat. And a 624-calorie Brie and Bacon Panini from Caffè Nero comes in at more than 100 calories higher than a 518-calorie McDonald’s Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Consumer group Which?, which conducted the research, said it was surprised to find that three of the sandwiches it surveyed contained more than three teaspoons of sugar. These included Pret’s Posh Cheddar and Pickle on Artisan, which contains 17.6g of sugar – equivalent to more than four teaspoons. Which? added it was easy for customers to overeat at lunchtime, with dishes such as Morrisons’ Tomato and Basil Chicken Pasta, which states it contains seven servings, often eaten by one person – meaning they consume 683 calories and 38.6g of fat in one sitting. This is more than Burger King’s Chicken Royale with Cheese, which has 648 calories and 37.2g of fat.

Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July,\" reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI .", "reference_summary": "World War I graffiti is discovered in an underground quarry .

Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however - I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave.

SAMPLE SIZE: If you're doing your make-up yourself, visit a make-up counter for tips and only buy only the items you'll definitely use again. For the things you'll only use on the day, scoop up the samples. 12. SOMETHING BORROWED: Rather than splashing the cash on expensive accessories and jewellery, borrow a few items from the women you love. Grandmother's bracelet, your mother's ring and your best friend's earrings will imbue the big day with even greater meaning. 13. GO SUPERSIZE: If you're not keen on the idea of a three-course meal, serve a family-style buffet on each table. Huge pasta dishes, massive salads and big rice bowls will not only cut costs but also serve as an icebreaker and act as a centerpiece. 14. ASK YOUR GUESTS TO STAND: Consider a standing ceremony if you're tying the knot outside to save on renting chairs. Plus, it will cut down the time of the wedding and thus cost. 15. SKIP THE BREAD BASKET: What sounds like such a simple tip will actually bring the cost down a lot. No bread means less cutlery, butter and expenditure.", "reference_summary": "FEMAIL has compiled the best budgeting tips for brides-to-be . Seat guests on larger tables to save decor costs .

And now experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive 'hats' made of red stone on top of some of the figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago. They believe that the hats, or 'pukao', were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures which measure up to 40ft (12 metres) tall. Mystery solved? Experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the Easter Island figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago . Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the University of Oregon, believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy. ‘It seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it, either by levering or rolling,’ he told the 80th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. This is despite the largest pukaos measuring six-and-a-half feet (two metres) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes (1,890 stone). Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents. A tall order: Physicists believe that the pukao, or 'hats,' were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures (examples are pictured left and right), some of which measure up to 40 ft (12 metres) tall . Remote: Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents . The Moai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island, between 1,250 and 1,500 AD. All the figures have overly-large heads and are thought to be living faces of deified ancestors. The 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft (four metres). All but 53 of the Moai were carved from tuff - compressed volcanic ash - and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria. In 1979 archaeologists said the statues were designed to hold coral eyes. The figures are believed to be symbol of authority and power. They may have embodied former chiefs and were repositories of spirits or 'mana'. They are positioned so that ancient ancestors watch over the villages, while seven look out to sea to help travellers find land. But it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position. The island is half the size of the Isle of Wight, or twice the size of Manhattan, and lies 2,236 miles (3,600km) west of the South American mainland. Since Europeans came to Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, in the 1700s, people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected, complete with their 'hats'. Some experts believe the stones were walked into place, while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position, unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources. An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues, or scattered nearby. They are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been, with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems. Despite this, many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance. Mr Hixon’s team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a Moai’s head, using different techniques. These included rolling a ‘hat’ up a ramp, building a tower, using a pulley system and putting the ‘hat’ on the statue before raising the whole statue as one. They concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp. Standing guard: An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues or scattered nearby. This map shows the location of the 887 statues, which gaze inland across the island, with an average height of 13ft (four metres) It may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a ‘hat’ into place, because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again, but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards. Some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao. And a number of the ‘hats also have vertical marks and ring-shaped indentations on their side, which may indicate that strips of wood were used to provide traction up the ramp. However, while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats, their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible - with enough manpower. Erosion and damage have also scarred the sides of the pukao, meaning that analysis of marks and scratches is 'far from conclusive'. It is not known exactly how the vast Easter Island statues came to line the perimeter of the small island. But in 2013, scientists claimed they may have been walked into position. A team led by Archaeologists Carl Lipo from the University of California State University Long Beach, and Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii claimed the statues' bases were carved so they could lean forward to make them easier to transport. Walk the walk: A team of experts created a five-tonne replica of one of the statues and moved it into an upright position on a dirt path in Hawaii, to prove that the statues could have been 'walked' into place . The researchers illustrated the theory by creating a five-tonne replica of one of the statues and moving it into an upright position on a dirt path in Hawaii. With just a few ropes, a team of 18 people could rock the statue back and forth, each time inching the statue on just a little bit more. The mode of transport would have taken about two weeks. The bases would then have been flattened to stand the statues upright once they reached position. Mr Lipo said the findings may help dismantle the traditional story line of Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, that a 'crazed maniacal group destroyed their environment,' by cutting down trees to transport gigantic statues. Previous studies have suggested that a lost civilization chopped down trees on the island, laid the statues prone and rolled them into place using logs.", "reference_summary": "Rapa Nui people placed red stone 'hats' or pukao on some of the statues .

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’", "reference_summary": "Jordon Ibe to put pen to paper on a new long-term deal at Liverpool .

The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991, and that the pair were 'inseparable' growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns. The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\" The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with.

Missing his wife who had recently passed away from cancer, a desperate Ted Koran, 59, phoned the Veterans Suicide Hotline but all he got was a recorded message. Ted said he was put on hold three times for 10 minutes at a time and the only reason he decided not to kill himself on Saturday was to care for the 60 rescue animals he and his wife had looked after together. Scroll down for video . Depression: Ted Koran says that he came very close to ending his own life when he failed to get through to a counselor on the VA Suicide Hotline on Saturday . 'My wife and I saved them, and they saved me,' Ted Koran said to ABC Action News from his home in Florida. Ted Koran's experience highlights the increasing problems the VA is facing with its Veterans Crisis Hotline as it fights depression among ex-servicemen. First set up in 2007, the service had 60 calls a day on four manned phone lines. Today it has 52 operators fielding up to 1,000 phone calls a day, but the service is at breaking point. Despite statistics which say 22 veterans end their lives every day across the US, depressed former soldiers are still being put on hold by helplines. Sadness: Ted (right in his Air Force uniform) said he was thinking suicidal thoughts because he was struggling to deal with the loss of his wife Karen, (left with Ted) who passed away six months ago . Anguish: Ted said that he has battled with severe depression since his wife (Karen, right) passed away and wanted someone to talk to on Saturday night . Love: The Koran's ran The Critter Place out of Weeki Wachee in Florida and only the thought of the 60 animals he and Karen (pictured) cared for stopped Ted from ending his own life on Saturday . Help: The loss of Karen (pictured) was devastating to Ted. The Veterans Association estimates that 22 former servicemen and women end their lives daily - a figure that could be reduced they claim if they got more funding for their helpline service. On Saturday, Ted admitted to suffering an emotional breakdown. 'I was missing my wife Karen,' he said to ABC Action News. Ted's wife passed away from cancer six months ago and he says he needed help. 'I went to the only place that I knew and that I had available to me, the VA,' said Ted. The first call for help Ted made to the James Haley VA Center in Tampa ended in a recorded message giving him the 800 number hotline. He claims he was then put on hold for 10 minutes. 'I had to sit there patiently, in emotional distress, in tears, wanting to give up, desperately needing someone to talk to,' said Ted to ABC Action News. Much loved: Ted has assured his friends and family that he will get through the death of this wife (pictured) and has asked them not to worry . Frustrated, Ted said he hung up and redialled two more times. 'They had me on the verge of saying to hell with it,' he said. Damningly, Ted claims that when he finally got hold of a counselor, they were of little help. A Scripps national investigation also found shocking instances of suicidal vets unable to get through to speak to a counselor. One veteran claims he was on hold for 36 minutes. 'The very ones that are supposed to be there for me let me down,' said Ted. However, following national attention, Ted claims he was phoned by the VA who wanted to speak to him. Ted took to Facebook on Tuesday and wrote that the two phone calls he had with the VA were a mixed bag. 'Had two calls from the VA. One from a social worker at the James Haley Tampa VA. Another from the VA crisis hotline headquarters,' wrote Ted to Facebook. 'The first hour long conversation didn't go so well. He ended up getting upset at me because by the end I felt that he was just doing his job and I didn't feel any compassion in that he only called me because his superior told him to contact me. 'He was the very reason I was reluctant to seek 'professional' help for so long. 'The VA Crisis hotline call went totally different. By the end of that hour long conversation I wish I could have given her a hug.' For confidential support in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255.

Late in the summer of 2012, just a couple of months into the reign of Brendan Rodgers, he was lined up as makeweight in a failed bid to sign Fulham's Clint Dempsey only for the midfielder to reject the move. His determination to prove himself, and justify the £16million price tag which came with him from Sunderland the previous summer, has been rewarded not only with a new five-year £100,000-a-week contract but with the prospect of him taking over the captain's armband from Steven Gerrard when he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice-captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . But it is the unfulfilled potential which persuaded the 24-year-old England international to commit what should be the best years of his career to the club. 'A few years ago I had an opportunity to leave but I always knew how big this club is and I wanted to stay here for as long as possible - and nothing has changed since then,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'I feel as though I have got a good connection with the club now and there was no doubt where my future was going to be and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. 'I have been through difficult times but I would never change that because I know there will be more difficult times ahead and I'll have to use that and I'll be able to handle it a lot better. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson arrived from Sunderland in a £16million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager .

In a report issued to the Herald Sun, Victoria police revealed that there is a distribution network of speed, ice and marijuana operating in the trucking industry and one in every 12 truckies tested positive for drugs while out on the road. Speaking to the publication, a former Melbourne truck driver said his colleagues were taking drugs regularly, and meeting areas were often set up between drivers over radios using codes, where drugs were then handed out. Scroll down for video . A new report has shown that truck drivers in Victoria are dealing drugs from the behind the wheel of 60-tonne rigs, using secretive codes over their radio systems . 'Yes, some people take speed and ice but there is ­always going to be rampant drug use if truckers are ­required to work these long hours,' the truck driver said. 'Do you think these people are dancing and raving in their trucks? No, it's not for fun they are using, it as a tool to do their jobs.' 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice. Detective Inspector Bernie Rankin, head of Victoria Police's transport investigations unit, said these flippant drivers were treating other motorists like roadkill and are risking everyone's lives. 156 truck drivers tested positive for drugs on Victoria's roads in the past year alone and it was revealed that they are using their log books to roll out lines and smoke ice . 'There are various ways these distribution networks are working. Often it's from a geographical location, they might know a driver who is involved in the industry, a pick-up point or there might be a loading area where there will be someone with illicit substances,' Inspector Rankin said. The news comes after a worrying video has appeared online in February exposing a truck driver snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road. The shocking footage shows that many drivers are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day. One truck driver filmed himself lighting up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the Hume Highway in an A Current Affair report. A worrying video appeared online in February exposing a truck driver (above) snorting drugs from behind the wheel of a heavy vehicle before taking to the road . The driver was embarking on a 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney . 'And yep… Fatigue about to be managed. Get it into ya,' the driver says in the clip, where he documented how and when he took the substances, telling viewers that he snorted the drug off his log book and also used a pipe. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the Hume Highway, which is an 807km road between Melbourne and Sydney. When cornered by Martin King from A Current Affair, the driver denied his involvement in the video and refused to comment. However, Simon Green, a former employee of the same company where the 'lunatic truckie' works said drugs are rampant in the trucking industry. Mr Green, who used to take part in recreational drug taking while he was a truck driver, now admits that it was dangerous and stupid but claims it is easy to get around the police and it is cheaper than you would think. The shocking footage comes after it has emerged that one in 12 truckies are high on illicit substances when they are pulled over by Victorian police and many are rorting the system so they can drive for up to 16 hours a day . One truck driver (pictured) has filmed himself lighting up a pipe filled with Ice (methamphetamine) and taking to the highway in a new A Current Affair report . When NSW police busted Mr Green for driving while under the influence of drugs, he lost his licence for a year and is now clean. He said the general public would be stunned if they knew the extent to which illicit substances are used by truckies out on the road in their rigs. 'I'd say at least 10 per cent of the drivers out there are doing it right now,' Mr Green said. However, speaking to the program, Inspector Bernie Rankin said he had underestimated the figure, claiming one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs when they are pulled over. The horrifying part is that the trucker is behind a 40-tonne truck and is just about to embark on his 12 hour shift on the road . one in 12 heavy vehicle drivers test positive for drugs like Ice (pictured) when they are pulled over. Mr Green said he knew his limits when it came to taking the drug, but Inspector Rankin claims that is 'absolute nonsense'. 'A multitude of medical studies done throughout the world all reach the conclusion that ingesting these type of substances impacts critically on your ability to drive, observe what's going on around you and the ability to even control the vehicle you're in,' he said. According to the law, heavy vehicle drivers are supposed to only drive for a maximum of 12 hours a day. The diver acted innocent and denied his involvement in the video when he was confronted by A Current Affair . The shocking video shows a man inhaling a drug through a pipe while telling viewers that he is heading north on the Hume Highway . However, drivers have now worked out that they can manipulate their log books through a loophole and they can actually work a 16.25 hour day in 24 hours. Speaking to the Herald Sun, Inspector Rankin said they are concerned that illicit drug taking is contributing to the amount of truck crashes on the road each year . 'This manipulation of their work diary gives regulated heavy vehicle drivers the opportunity to drive in excess of their prescribed hours four times in a seven-day period and be non-prosecutable,' he said.

Schuler said Durst was a generous tipper and although there were some strange things about his nature he did not think of him as a threat. A few months later Durst was arrested for allegedly killing and dismembering his neighbor, Morris Black - he was found not guilty. Last week Durst's first court date culminated in a shouting match after none of his lawyers' witnesses showed up. He is awaiting extradition to face murder charges in California appeared in New Orleans accused of illegal gun possession. Controversial: Robert Durst, 71, (file image pictured) is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000 . His defense team was expected to challenge the case by accusing police of searching Durst's hotel room in the city without a proper arrest warrant. However, as a shackled Durst appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom, the judge raged at his attorneys for being unprepared as they requested to delay the hearing. Durst was arrested on March 14 on charges of possession of a weapon by a felon and possession of a gun with a controlled substance, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but has yet to be formally charged. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. Authorities who searched the room, where Durst stayed under an alias, claim to have found over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said. On Thursday, the judge eventually agreed to postpone the hearing until next week, when the witnesses - two FBI agents and a state trooper - could be charged with contempt of court for failing to appear. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. He is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000. The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings.

Moore has been on the run from the law for more than four decades, until Monday afternoon when he called the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Kentucky and admitted to being a fugitive. Sheriff Pat Melton says Moore, 66, was at the former Polk Youth Institute in Butner, North Carolina, serving a sentence of more than 10 years for larceny when he broke free June 10, 1972. Scroll down for video . Captured: Clarence David Moore, 66, is seen being wheeled from his home in Frankfort, Kentucky, Monday, after he admitted to being a fugitive who escaped from a North Carolina prison in 1972 . Medical necessity: Moore suffers from several medical conditions and cannot walk, but because he has no Social Security card of any form of ID, he has been unable to receive medical treatment . At 4pm Monday, nearly 43 years after Moore’s escape, he finally emerged from the shadows. ‘I need to make this right and get through this,’ Moore was quoted as telling Sheriff Melton. After sheriff's deputies verified Moore's story, he was taken into custody. The 66-year-old, who suffers from several unspecified ailments and apparently cannot walk on his own, was captured by the station WTVQ being wheeled out of his Frankfort home on a gurney and taken to a hospital before being sent to jail. He explained to investigators he has not been able to get medical treatment because he does not have a Social Security card or any other form of identification. According to the sheriff's office, the man’s unexpected decision to give himself up after all these years was motivated by his desire to see a doctor. Now it will be up to prosecutors in North Carolina to decide whether to pursue extradition in Moore's case. Hiding in plain sight: Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street . According to North Carolina Department of Public Safety prison records obtained by WHAS11, Clarence Moore, who also went by the name David Moore, had been convicted of larceny in July 1967. Moore told deputies in Kentucky that the charge stemmed from the theft of two television sets. He was originally scheduled to be released June 1, 1978. During his time as an outlaw, Moore had worked on a ship for many years before moving to Frankfort and settling in a tidy red-brick home with white columns along a tree-lined residential street. When in 2009 he was involved in a car crash, Moore gave his name as Ronnie Dickinson to protect his true identity. He is now facing a charge of contempt of court in Kentucky for misrepresenting himself to police five years ago.

Because they left Spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins, over Peru and the USA, the booing, whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win Euro 2008. Three trophies later, the senior team is finally in search of a reboot. The identity has been eroded by the passage of time. The transition from excellent to elderly is never fun. Spain lift the trophy at Euro 2008, but their fans had booed them before, not recognising a great team . The World Cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters . Spain won the European Championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their World Cup failure . Spain's Under 21s celebrate winning Euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now . Nevertheless, the current Champions League quarter-finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about Spain's 'relevo'. If you don't speak Spanish, that term might mean very little to you. But I bet you can intuit. 'Relevo' in this context is like 'relief' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch. Those who are sent in, fresh and ready, to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days. Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a \"Spanish school\" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just \"training\" and \"playing\". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'", "reference_summary": "When Spain first became a real power, their own fans didn't know at first .

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. Johnson said he had no figure for the value of what was stolen. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds, or 300 million dollars, in a remark widely reported by news media. And numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. But Johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving them in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. Over the four-day Easter holiday, an unknown number of thieves broke into the vault and might have been able to take as much as four days to rifle through the boxes. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the UK capable of having pulled it off. He said had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway?

Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village.

Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 . The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university. 'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC. The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC. 'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said. The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students. Sandstone halls: The University of Sydney's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, has run the pilot program with Scot's College. Pictured above is the university's clocktower and the eastern range of its main building precinct . However, at the time it was shutdown, the board was unaware that Scot's College were planning the pilot with another 11 boys this year. My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools. Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mind . Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College. He agrees that the current HSC grading system works for the top 20 percent of students, but not for middle-ranking students. Do you know more?

Ms King shocked and intrigued the Australian public when she entered into a relationship with Thompson, who was twice her age, while he was also involved with Leona – who is nicknamed Le. The 60-year-old’s first meeting with Thompson was when she was 15 years old Sydney school girl, and has now revealed the salacious details of their 15-year affair and unconventional arrangement. Scroll down for video . Bunkie King, 60, has revealed how her three-way relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her sister worked . Ms King, also appeared with Thompson in 1975 movie Scobie Malone, had a 15-year affair with the womanising actor . Speaking with A Current Affair about her book, Somebody I Used to Know: Love, Loss and Jack Thompson, Ms King said she decided to pen a novel during an argument with her son. At one point, he shouted: 'I'm not proud that my mother had sex with her sister.' This was the moment Ms King realised there were many misconceptions about her relationship with the womanising actor. 'That really shocked me because that wasn't our relationship,' she said. 'It never entered my head [that's what people thought], so I put it down warts and all.' Ms King, who has two children with her ex-husband, also revealed how she shared one man with her sister, 20. A young Bunkie King pictured here with her sister Leona - nicknamed Le - and Jack Thompson . Le (pictured left) was 20 years old when she started a relationship with the Australian actor . Jack pictured in 1980 (left) and 2013 (right), was written about under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', when he told a newspaper he felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs' But from the start the siblings made it clear they were not going to sleep with him in the same bed. When Ms King first moved in with Le and Thompson she was 'allocated one night a week' with the actor. But then they relocated to Collaroy - on Sydney's North Shore - and the sisters would see him on alternating nights. Ms King said she had never close to Le and there were times where she felt her sister, who she is now estranged from, wished she had Thompson all to herself. But it was all or nothing with Thompson, who starred in Spyforce - an action series following Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. 'I was happy for whatever crumbs came off the table. It did cause problems with jealousy and things like that. I don't think either of us would have chosen it that way,' Ms King said. Cleo magazine featured him reclined naked on a sofa catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight . Talking to New Idea, Ms King said their relationship in many ways was 'quite old-fashioned'. 'We had separate bedrooms. He was just sleeping with both of us,' she said. In her interview with ACA, Ms King said her relationship was not a 'unique situation'. 'It is in western society but it's not a unique situation for a man to have more than one wife,' she said. 'In western society, a man generally speaking has a wife and a mistress or maybe a couple of mistresses.' But despite his commitment to two women, Ms King claims Thompson still had time to be unfaithful to her and Le. She said what hurt her the most about his alleged infidelities was the fact he was not open, honest and upfront about it. Ms King also revealed her sister did not know about her regular afternoon visits from Thompson at their mother's house when he started to court her. The visits in the 1970s increased to three a week and, after months of spending time together, she fell hopelessly in love knowing he was with Le. Ms King has revealed in her memoirs how, as a virgin, she struggled to dampen her feelings for the blond tanned hunk and desperately craved his love even after her sister caught them kissing. Heyday: The actor, pictured centre (moustache), starred alongside David Bowie (right) in 1983 movie Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence . Seventies hit: The star (right) was catapulted to fame for the series Spyforce, based on the adventures of Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II . Ms King writes: 'One night, he and I are kissing and cuddling in their bedroom when Le [Leona] bursts in the door yelling, \"What the hell are you doing?\" 'He jumps up off the bed and tries to calm her down. I bolt out of the room, down the stairs, through the front door and out into the street. 'I know there's something wrong with what we've been doing. He's obviously Le's boyfriend and I feel bad for her, but I don't know how to give him up.' It was the same for Jack too and, with his popularity at its height in the mid-1970s, the Wake In Fright star bought a rambling farm in the hills above Coffs Harbour, on the NSW mid-north coast, and convinced the sisters to share an 'open' and 'honest' relationship with him. New Idea magazine is on sale now . They moved in together, Ms King confined to the smaller room, while Leona shares the master bedroom with the actor, now dubbed 'Jack The Lady Killer' by the media. In her book, the 60-year-old also speaks frankly about her drug use, ranging from marijuana to acid to heroin. But she did not classify her drug use as 'hardcore'. 'Hardcore to me is someone who is basically mainlining. It was the 60s and the 70s,' Ms King said. During the early years of their relationship, Cleo magazine featured Thompson reclined on a sofa in a pose emulating a classic nude, Titian's Venus d'Urbino, catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight. In 1972, Ms King evealed she fell pregnant for the first time, having forgotten to take the Pill, and underwent the first of three terminations over 15 years. As Jack's fame grew, journalists clamoured for details about the nature of his threesome relationship and in October 1974, he granted Sydney's Daily Telegraph an interview. Published under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', he claimed that he occasionally felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs.' The truth, however, no doubt lies somewhere in between. Ms King says a serious showdown in Spain forced her to finally flee and maintains throughout her 15 years as Jack's lover, she never knew if she was genuinely wanted or was 'just an interloper.' Today she works in nursing and is divorced with a son Stephan, 17, and daughter, and lives a quiet life south of Sydney. And for his part, Jack remains with Leona, with whom he shares a son Billy, and the pair lead a reclusive life in Ulong in New South Wales.", "reference_summary": "Bunkie King was a 15-year-old Sydney schoolgirl when she met the actor .

The family of a woman who battled a cancerous brain tumour for 14 years has claimed her diamond engagement ring was 'forcefully removed and stolen' from her finger at a nursing home just days before she passed away. Christine Davidson, from Adelaide, South Australia, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2001, and told she only had between nine months to three years to live. After enduring an incredible 14 years of chemotherapy and radiation, the mother of two lost her battle to cancer last Thursday morning at an Adelaide nursing home at the age of 61. But four days before she died, her husband Ronny and their two daughters Symantha, 40, and Kelly, 38, noticed her ring was missing from her finger. 'Dad noticed the bruises around her finger and asked us if we managed to get the ring off,' Symantha told Daily Mail Australia. 'Three weeks prior to her passing, we tried to remove the ring because it started to cut her circulation but we had no luck after trying everything we could think of.’ The family has launched a desperate online appeal in a bid to have their mother's ring returned. Christine Davidson (left) who was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, pictured with her husband Ronny (right) and their daughter Symantha (centre) Christine and her husband Ronny were happily married for 41 years before she passed away . Kelly took to her Facebook account last Wednesday to post an emotional appeal and has since attracted more than 117,000 shares and almost 17,000 likes. 'We just don't understand how someone could steal from a dying woman,' Symantha said. ‘The ring was a sign of mum and dad’s long lasting love and their strong marriage – they were happily married for 41 years before she passed. ‘Mum also promised to give the ring to her only granddaughter who she was very close to - My daughter Jayda, 17, but now she’s devastated.' Christine was working at an insurance company before her sickness came on suddenly 14 years ago . Christine, who fell suddenly ill 14 years ago, pictured with her grandchildren last Christmas . On March 28, the family was told their mother, grandmother and wife was on her 'final stage of life'. ‘She was a nanna to four amazing grandchildren and she was the best mum we could ever ask for,' Symantha said. 'The last 14 years was hard on our family because we were forced to watch her suffer but we're happy she's at peace now and she’s not in pain anymore. ‘Multiple neurosurgeons were blown away with what she had accomplished after she fought hard to kick the rare long-lasting tumour - she was a brave fighter.' Christine was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and was told she only had up to three years to live . Symantha said she has informed the police about the missing ring. Daily Mail Australia has contacted South Australian police for comment. Christine lived at the retirement home, which the family has asked Daily Mail Australia to keep anonymous, for more than four years. 'The majority of the nurses were fantastic and mum was cared for very well,' Kelly said.

As the Boston Marathon runners begin and, hopefully, finish their exhausting run Monday, the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways. More public safety officials throughout the route, a finish line area that prohibits large bags, National Guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security -- those are the most obvious, visible changes. And there are less obvious ones too. With the luxury of some time and healing, the city has moved on. And that is a blessing. In the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings, the manhunt, the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the Tsarnaev brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on. But we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness, the fog of war. Sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions. That narrative is just forming, and it's worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week. As a former homeland security adviser for Massachusetts, I was intimately involved with the marathon planning; as a commentator for CNN, I saw the story evolve during that week. Some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight, others by various after-action reports and assessments, and others by the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts. On Tuesday, the trial's sentencing phase will begin, determining whether he will receive the death penalty. In national security circles, there is often a debate about whether the U.S. judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials. Terrorism, the argument goes, is different from traditional crimes, and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats. Even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the Boston Marathon trial made clear that the system does work. What was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional. Prosecutors presented evidence. Defense attorneys challenged the witnesses. The defendant chose not to testify. A verdict was rendered. Its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases, but also took the mythology (maybe even the romanticism) of terrorism out of the case. It rendered Tsarnaev a common criminal. And that was a statement worth making. Recent reports about the shootout in Watertown that Friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt. It is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of Massachusetts Transit Police Officer Richard Donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure. Maybe it was adrenaline, maybe it was just the nature of the weapons. What is clear -- in Watertown and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now. That is a dangerous gap, and too many police departments are failing to address it. We have a notion of \"Boston Strong\" coming from the attacks and the city's response. I never loved the term, mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have Puritan stock and a kick-ass attitude. That is only partially true. We risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a \"keep calm\" persona. I have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response. The quick decisions to move runners off Boylston Street, the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so, the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers. It is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only. One part of the response that doesn't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks. Runners had no access to phones, and often had no identification. Family members of runners often didn't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route. First responders, in particular the Boston police and the Red Cross, focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to Commonwealth Avenue, a few blocks from the finish line. Once family members know that they are with loved ones, the trauma subsides. They often leave the scene, freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs. Crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster: Is my family OK? Obviously, there is so much more to learn. Could the bombing have been avoided? What would have happened if the FBI had shared information it had on the Tsarnaev family with local police? What if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers? It's \"woulda, coulda, shoulda\" but still essential. One of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isn't simply for blame, but to get better for the next time. Analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient. But do not believe that we are done learning. Looking back can be risky; it's often called the \"blinding clarity of hindsight\" because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror. But I have no doubt that at future anniversaries, what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written. And maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead.", "reference_summary": "Boston Marathon takes place Monday, two years after bombing, and sentencing phase of trial begins Tuesday .

Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race . Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport.

But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return.

Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Months before Binh's transplant, Michael Wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister Phuoc (right) to receive part of his liver . Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge.

Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack \"brought the devil out in him\" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December. He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial. If the state Supreme Court agrees, Spell would be committed to a state mental institution, Avignone said.", "reference_summary": "Sherry Arnold, a 44-year-old math teacher from Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7, 2012, when she was abducted .

Scott Shirley, his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix, were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World, Orlando, when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew. After boarding the plane, the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet. Scroll down for video . Mayo Shirley, son Phoenix, and husband Scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a United Airlines flight . After putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin, the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . Mr Shirley told MailOnline Travel: 'My wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting. It was then, that she noticed her bag was wet. 'She then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet. When she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid, that's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit. 'Given my wife suffers from Mysophobia (phobia of germs), she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit. 'I immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that I too had had my hands all over this vomit. My wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind. 'I told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms.' The Shirley's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . Mr Shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area, and that staff had cleaned the area. 'It was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting, because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever,' he added. 'This was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks.' Mr Shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking, and they were given two options by United staff; fly out next day or remain in their seats. Because Mrs Shirley had to go to work next day at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats. The family were flying back on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Washington (file photo) However, staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area, and the passengers were given blankets, which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell. Mr Shirley said: 'The pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made. He told us we had to make a decision because he can't delay the other passengers. 'It was at this point I felt as if they couldn't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along. I told my wife that we should just take the next day flight. 'She said it isn't an option for her due to her position with the FDA and the nine days she had already been on holiday. Since we really had no choice in the matter, under duress of the situation, we agreed to the blanket option.' The family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in. 'It was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family,' added Mr Shirley. 'I felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us. This was the final straw for me. 'We went straight to United customer service who told us they can't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there. This was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there. No assistance was offered.' With their luggage still bagged up, Mr Shirley says United Airlines have offered them a $150 flight voucher each and some 'mileage points' A spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: The situation Mr Shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences, as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure. 'We offered them an alternate flight, but they decided to remain onboard. Our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate Mr Shirley and keep the flight on time. 'We’re reaching out to apologise for his experience.' The family were offered a $150 flight voucher, or the option to file a claim for the baggage, which they chose to do. Upon returning home, United has offered the each member of the family a $150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for Mrs Shirley. However, Mr Shirley said: 'I personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell. 'I don't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience. We have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and I'm beginning to think the train might be an option.

An example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy. Among the feel-good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap. Reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed. You cannot reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best-buy at Morrison’s. Experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones, enjoying warm weather, eating wonderful home-cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably. It’s not rocket science. Surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy. Here’s my list of pet hates — which gets longer by the day: . In the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy, Janet Street-Porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day! TRENDY MEN WITH BUSHY BEARDS . Is there anything less attractive than a man’s chin covered by a thick mat of hair? God forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a Sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of Moses. SECRET FACE-LIFTS . Every September, I encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut, whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes. Although they put this good health down to a ‘wonderfully restful holiday’, the truth is they’ve had a face-lift. NASTY LITTLE SACHETS . The bane of B&Bs, cafes and hotels. What’s wrong with a pot of jam on the table? WEATHER DOLLIES . Every night these simpering females appear on local TV news bulletins, posing pertly in front of a map of Britain in very high heels, and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks, waving perfectly manicured hands around. VOUCHERS PAST USE-BY DATES . As a dedicated bargain-hunter, it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully-collected discount vouchers have expired. Janet is a self-confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date . ANYTHING CALLED ‘AN EXPERIENCE’ Shopping has become a pastime, like making raffia mats or embroidery, and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘experience’. Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash? This drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in Boots. Janet remains baffled by pay-by-phone car parking, what's wrong with cash? QUEUE-JUMPERS AT AIRPORTS . After patiently waiting my turn, I could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘friend’ in the queue in front on me. SUPERFOODS . Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of ‘de-planing’ (don’t they mean ‘disembarking’ or ‘getting off’)? Railway stations are described as ‘calling points’. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians ‘jubilating’ after the country’s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘stake-holders’. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the ‘re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: ‘It doesn’t work!’ ‘Re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil’s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it’s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly. Being confronted by an embarrassed 16-year-old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining!", "reference_summary": "An increasing number of surveys claim to reveal what makes us happiest .

But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw.

The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by £6.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the £12billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is £6.50 an hour and will rise to £6.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity’s report complains: ‘The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.’ Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s posted combined profits of £3.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than £750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid £519m in tax but received £364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent £150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received £221m in benefits. Morrisons’ tax bill was £62m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received £190m in benefits and Sainsbury’s paid £180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of £2,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of £6.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’ Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an ‘invention’. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. ‘For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,’ he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: ‘The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.’ He called on the next government to show leadership ‘by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning’. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: ‘The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. ‘The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn’t even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. ‘At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn’t playing its part to help the country recover.’ All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it ‘should consider doing so’. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was ‘madness’ that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: ‘Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.’ Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: ‘If employees weren’t getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?’ Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits ‘should be considered in the round’. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart’s low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (£4.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury’s said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed £1.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about £8.40 an hour and the industry had paid £19.5bn in ‘core business taxes’ last year.

Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said. Galbraith says he and the late Galbraith were 'not friends per se,' but they shared mutual friends and knew each other on a first-name basis.

The part-time actor was going through customs to board his EasyJet flight, when airport staff discovered he had six £1.80 tubs of the traditional pudding and North East delicacy in his hand luggage. The boiled-legume dish was removed from his bags, along with several Greggs pies. Pease pudding is a traditional dish made with split peas and a favourite in the North East of England . The 58-year-old, who previously appeared in the BBC TV series Blackadder, was surprised at the mix-up. 'I love my pease pudding,' he told The Mirror. 'I think the resemblance to Semtex was pushing it a bit far as it was in containers marked pease pudding.' Security staff told the traveller his pease pudding could 'technically' be classed as Semtex . However, the traveller did admit he was carrying six tubs of the pudding along with pies from the Greggs bakery - which became synonymous with the 'pasty tax' introduced and then scrapped by Chancellor George Osborne in 2012. After being told that the consistency of the pudding could see it 'technically' classed as Semtex, he reportedly offered to let security taste the delicacy to prove it wasn't. Luckily for the pease-lover, who lives in Sussex, he was allowed through with his snacks and was simply warned to pack them in hold luggage the next time he was travelling. The traveller has also placed several Greggs pies in his hand luggage for the journey . An customs spokeswoman said: 'There is no customs policy with regard to pease pudding so far as I am aware.' When MailOnline contacted a Newcastle Airport spokeswoman, she said they do not comment on security matters. It is not the first time unusual items have been picked up by airport security scanners. Stansted Airport has previously confiscated items including furry handcuffs, while two Italian women were stopped at Munich Airport, in Germany for trying to transport a human skeleton belonging to a dead relative. Last year, customs officers at Birmingham Airport seized a giant squash from a passenger who was trying to smuggle it into Britain from Asia. The 4ft-long vegetable, which weighed in more than at 4st, was found with 175lb (79kg) of fish and 94,000 cigarettes from Bangladesh. A spokesman for Solihull Council said: 'It is a bit of a rare find, as you can imagine we do get cigarettes a lot, but not a squash, especially not one of this size.'

He will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain. A source close to Mr Farage said he was taking time out from the campaign trail in Britain to focus the election debate on immigration. Campaign bosses believe a provocative intervention could have the same effect as his controversial remarks on foreigners with HIV being treated in Britain – which were part of a so-called ‘shock and awful’ strategy to get attention and appeal to the party’s ‘core voters’. Mr Farage thinks his party could still get more than ten MPs if he manages to cause a ‘big shock’ in the eight days before polling day. A senior Ukip aide said: ‘He needs to make a special intervention. This is a big moment in the campaign. ‘Cameron and Miliband do not want to talk about this because they know the whole issue hinges on EU membership. ‘Nigel is going to highlight how jihadis are entering Europe, getting EU passports, and then are able to easily come to Britain because of the open-borders policy. 'If there is going to be one country where these guys are going to head to, it is going to be us because of the Iraq war and our involvement in Afghanistan and against Islamic State.’ Mr Farage said yesterday he opposed EU action to tackle migrant deaths in the Mediterranean because it could lead to a common migration policy and let millions of people into Britain. He added that the problem had the potential to be more damaging than the eurozone crisis. Mr Farage will warn that if the EU agrees to give refuge to migrants from North Africa, it could lead to millions being given passports that allow them to move to Britain . ‘I think what is happening in Strasbourg is far more significant than anything that has been said by any of the party leaders about immigration … during this campaign,’ he said. ‘They utterly refuse to accept that we are no longer in control of our borders … ‘I’m quite certain Miliband and Cameron will try and ignore this, so I am going there [Strasbourg] to engage in that debate and make sure they cannot ignore it.’ He added: ‘Are we about to see one of the great Brussels dreams come true … a common EU immigration policy? We currently have a net migration figure of 300,000. Goodness knows what it could be if this happens. 'Potentially EU passports are about to be given to a very large number of people and the British political class in Westminster is powerless.’ Mr Farage’s speech could be his last in the European Parliament if he is elected MP for Thanet South.

Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years. And no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe will be paid out, regardless of how long an EU migrant has paid into UK coffers under the plans. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.", "reference_summary": "Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .

Luke is with his family at Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration and hypothermia when he was found. He is unlikely to suffer any long term effects from his traumatic ordeal. Paediatrician Amy Gray said Luke was still a bit weak and tired, but asking for food. 'It's an amazingly happy outcome after what has clearly been an incredibly stressful, traumatic experience,' she said on Wednesday. 'I don't know that any of us know exactly what he's been through, but ... we think he's doing fabulously for someone who has been through what we can only imagine, and certainly in much better condition than what we'd expect.'

A camera on the helicopter captured the dramatic moment rescuers reached Luke on the fourth day of an increasingly desperate search . A police officer was first on the site, and he knelt down and offered Luke reassurance he was finally safe . Dr Gray said he was improving with each hour and doctors did not expect him to have any ongoing physical problems from the ordeal. 'Aside from the dehydration he's tired and weak, again as you would expect, but there's no other real major physical issues at this stage,' she said. 'He seems very content and settled in the ward and happily interacting with the family.' A desperate search for Luke was mounted after he went missing from the Candlebark Campground near Lake Eildon on Friday.

Luke was found just before midday AEST on Tuesday in bushland off Skyline Road, 3km from the campsite . 'I'm not sure we'll ever know.' Mr Nugent on Tuesday said Luke's survival in the cold, wet, rugged terrain was a miracle. SES spokesman Brent Sergeant said the more days that passed during the search for Luke, the harder it became for volunteers.

Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said.

That’s what you feel when you meet a rhino in the wild. You just can’t come to terms with the fact that you and he are sharing the same air, the same continent, the same century. I’ve had close-up experience with three of the world’s five surviving species of rhino: the white rhino looks like the main battle tank of an extra-terrestrial army, while the black is more like a hot-rod armoured car. The greater one-horned rhino, meanwhile, sometimes called the Indian rhino, looks as if it’s been riveted together from pieces of boiler-plate. Surely they can’t be real. You feel as if you’ve slipped back into the Jurassic era and were looking at some great horned dinosaur, for they couldn’t possibly be part of the 21st century. It’s as if the creatures of the past had suddenly invaded the present, as if the Lost World of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had been found again. Scroll down for video . Guarded: A four man team of armed guards now protects Sudan the Northern White Rhino who is the last male of his species . But then you think: hang on a minute. These rhinos are nothing to do with dinosaurs or with any vanished world. They’re mammals, just like you and me, and they’re as admirably adapted for the current century as we are. They’re as modern as a child born yesterday: part of our present, not part of our past. Yes, give them a fair crack of the whip and they’d be as successful as any of the big creatures we have left on our planet, for in many countries the wild places they depend on are still in fine shape and perfectly capable of supporting any number of rhinos. So why are we running out of them? Why does the last surviving male of the northern sub-species of the white rhino now live under a 24-hour guard? Why has he been stripped of his horn? Why is it that we seem to be on the brink of losing an entire race of rhinos? Threatened: Sudan is the target of poachers looking to sell rhino horn which can make up to £47,000 a kilo . This is the lonely rhino, known as Sudan, guarded day and night by rangers who risk their own lives as they try to keep him from poachers. Even without his horn, his keepers in the Kenyan reserve of Ol Pejeta fear for his safety. It seems like madness —because it is madness. A rhino’s horn is made from keratin, the same stuff as fingernails. You could collect your nail clippings and try to sell them, claiming that they were magic and capable of curing all kinds of things. You could try selling your keratin at £47,000 a kilo. You probably wouldn’t find many takers, but it’s no more absurd than selling rhino horn for the same purposes and price. People will pay an absurd amount for an absurd product because of an absurd belief: that rhino horn is the most wonderful kind of medicine. Today, the wildlife business — including the sale of rhino horn — represents the third-largest illegal trade in the world, after arms and drugs. It offers a considerable opportunity for criminals, because the authorities don’t enforce the laws against it with anything like the same seriousness as they do with weapons and narcotics. And there is huge — and growing — demand. In 2007, 13 rhinos were poached and killed in South Africa. The horns were removed and they were sold on the Asian medicine market. Dangerous: The rangers are aware they are risking their lives to protect the enormous animal . Failure: But attempts at breeding have been unsuccessful - and Sudan is now getting old . Last year in South Africa 1,215 rhinos were poached and killed. That’s one every eight hours. We’re running out of rhinos. The massacre is taking place across Africa and into Asia. It’s driven by money, and the more horn costs the more desirable the stuff becomes. Prestige, status, vanity and belief in magic drive the trade in rhino horn. The fact that it’s useless for anyone but a rhino has no bearing on demand. Rhino horn has for centuries been part of traditional Chinese medicine, and it’s used to treat disorders of the blood. It’s never been used as an aphrodisiac: that’s a fantasy from bewildered Westerners. Increasing prosperity in China has led to higher demand. But as the South African poaching figures show, the market has jumped from steady but borderline sustainable to completely crazy, which has put rhinos on the fast-track to extinction. That’s largely because of the entry of a new player: Vietnam. The country’s new wealth has kick-started a craze for rhino horn. They take a much more free and easy attitude to its powers there: it’s regarded as a cure for cancer, and it’s also used a pick-me-up after a big night. The effects of a powerful hangover can, people believe, be controlled — all it takes is one very rich man and one very dead rhino. Can the trade possibly be stopped? There are two ways of doing so: policing the poaching, smuggling and sale with more commitment, and reducing the demand in the places where people buy the stuff. In 2012, the South African and Vietnamese governments signed a memorandum of understanding, agreeing to work with closer co-operation to stop the trade. You can see how well that’s worked. In Vietnam a non-governmental organisation called Education for Nature in Vietnam (ENV) is trying to make rhino horn uncool. It has a public service announcement with Vietnam’s great singing diva, Hong Nhung, standing by a poached and dehorned corpse telling the Vietnamese not to use rhino horn. And in another sequence, a comedian plays a rich man trying to impress the girls with his hideously expensive chunk of horn. The most beautiful girl says: ‘It impresses no one, especially not me.’ ENV runs a hotline for information about rhino horn use and a database. It also has good contacts in government and works on policy. The organisation has plenty of young volunteers and a good deal of their work is making rhino horn unthinkable for the next generation. It gets some of its funding from the excellent London-based organisation Save The Rhino — of which I’m a patron. Extreme measures: Rangers have even cut off the rhino's horn - but they fear it won't be enough . Hungry: Feeding time in Sudan's enclosure - he spent most of his life in a Czech zoo . There are also many good projects for rhino conservation in Africa and across the world. The Luangwa Valley in Zambia once held 4,000 black rhinos: they were poached out over 20 years and declared extinct in Zambia in 1998. Five years later, a project to release captive-bred black rhinos began: there are now 34 roaming free in the valley. Most problems with conservation come from the rising human population, and with it, the destruction of habitat. In so many parts of the world, we are running out of room. But there’s plenty of room left for rhinos in Africa. Conserving rhinos should be easy, yet they’re going extinct not because of overcrowding but from human folly. Rhinos are being killed because of belief in a discredited form of magic and the simple love of showing off. And yet you can go out into the wild areas of the world, especially in Africa, and still get close to these vast beasts. I once spent a day in Zimbabwe tracking a big male black rhino on foot and when at last we found him it seemed this might have been a mistake. There he was, 20 yards away, looking at me looking at him. One of those moments of eternity. But after a while he relaxed and got on with his life, snacking on bushes. Big solid, fast and armed with that wonderful great bodger on his bonce, he’s a modern creature fully equipped for the modern world, if only we’d let him get on with it. But we’re killing him off with money, greed, political inertia, incompetent policing, superstition and deadly vanity. So, a suggestion if you happen to be suffering from a hangover and wish to cure it. Try biting your nails. It’s every bit as effective as a dead rhino.", "reference_summary": "Sudan is guarded day and night by rangers to keep him from poachers .

Edward Schwarck, Research Fellow in Asia Studies at defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said that the installations China is building could lead to military conflict. He told MailOnline: ‘Assertive behaviour from China in this region is not a new thing. Chinese maritime law enforcement vessels have been harassing fishermen and US vessels for years. ‘The concern is that they give the Chinese military the ability to project force and sovereignty much better into the South China Sea. They could be used as launch pads for law enforcement vessels and harassing operations of other countries in the region. ‘These have been very provocative in the past and the installations mean more ships, that in turn escalates conflict.’ He added: ‘As they stand they’re not a threat.

General Catapang showed journalists surveillance photographs of construction work at Johnson, Fiery Cross, Cuarteron, Kennan and Gaven reefs. He added: 'Our biggest problem now is the Mischief Reef. This is worrisome. This is our main . concern now. This is the issue that we are now trying to . address. 'We feel that we are in a very difficult situation. If they reclaim the Mischief Reef, we will be cut off. We have a series of islands going down south and going up north. It will challenge the Ayungin Shoal that we are claiming. Military troops from the Philippines and United States hold up their respective national flags during opening rites of the Philippines-US Exercise Balikatan in Quezon City, east of Manila . Force: Following their release, U.S. President Barack Obama accused China of using its military might to reclaim the contested territory in the South China Sea . Worrying: A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the scale of China's land reclamation in the South China Sea (pictured) is fueling concerns in the region that China intends to militarise its outposts . Territory: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country has 'indisputable rights' to the Spratly Islands (pictured) and it was 'protecting its nation's sovereignty' Ownership: China claims the work is necessary to safeguard its sovereignty which it asserts over most of the South China sea . The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. There are soldiers there and if this happens, they are very near each other. I hope there will be no miscalculations or aggressiveness on both sides.' 'The president will raise... definitely the reclamation . issue,' Foreign Ministry official Luis Cruz official told . reporters. 'We would aim for a collective statement, this time . on the issue of the reclamation of some features in the South . China Sea.' Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak hosts the 26th . Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, which . begins on Friday. In an interview with AFP last week, President Aquino said the world should fear China's actions in the disputed sea, warning they could lead to military conflict. The United States' military commander for Asia has said China could eventually deploy radar and missile systems on the outposts it is building in the region, which would give it the power to enforce an exclusion zone. China's ambassador to the United States has said it was 'natural' that his country's reclamation work would include military defence facilities. Cui Tiankai said there 'should be no illusion that anyone could... repeatedly violate China's sovereignty without consequences'. Its actions in the South China Sea have been described as 'aggressive' by Senator John McCain, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. He urged President Obama's administration to move more military resources into the economically important Asian region - and boost cooperation with Asian countries worried by China. Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Akitaka Saiki said China had a duty to address regional concerns And his Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yong stressed the importance of stability in the South China Sea for trading nations like his. China's leadership hit back at U.S. President Barack Obama who recently condemned the country for constructing the artificial island on Mischief Reef. Obama claimed Beijing was 'using its sheer size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions'.", "reference_summary": "Philippines voiced alarm about Chinese 'aggressiveness' in the South China Sea ahead of war games with the US .

Guests attending a service in London to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo have been told not to act in a 'triumphalist' way – to avoid upsetting the French. Invitations to the service at St Paul's Cathedral advise that it will avoid glorifying the Duke of Wellington's historic victory over Napoleon in 1815. But last night the move was criticised by politicians, who said it 'took political correctness to an absurd new degree'. The invitation to the Waterloo 200 event says: 'The service, although related to a military victory, is not in any way glorifying war, nor must it be seen as triumphalist.' Instead, the service – to be attended by members of the Royal Family and senior political and military figures – will focus on the 'pan-European' implications of the battle and the century of peace that followed. Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is bidding to be re-elected as a Somerset MP, said: 'Waterloo was a triumph of good versus evil. Napoleon was responsible for between three million and 6.5 million deaths. 'Two hundred years on, it is ridiculous to spare the blushes of the French by not celebrating the battle for what it was. What next? Will we ask France to apologise for the Battle of Hastings?' The service of commemoration, to take place on the 200th anniversary of Waterloo on June 18, will be the centrepiece of a series of events to mark the battle. Waterloo 200 chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, defended the 'no triumphalism' theme. Asked if it looked as though the service was designed to avoid embarrassing the French, he said: 'Some people may read it like that but it's not how we look at it.' He added that the enemy at Waterloo was Napoleon – not France as such. The commemoration was highlighting the effect of the battle on Europe, not the military campaign or the battle itself. 'What Waterloo brought in was an extended period of peace in Europe after a particularly horrible 20 years of war,' Sir Evelyn said. 'The commemoration looks forward to the European harmony that followed it.' Colin Brown, author of Scum Of The Earth, a new book about Waterloo, said Wellington would not have objected to the non-triumphalist tone. He added: 'The Duke strongly believed in the restoration of the status quo after the battle, including the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France.'

The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000.

Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with.

Wanted: Female body double for Sienna Miller. Must have the same body measurements as the Hollywood actress – give or take a centimetre. But that hasn’t stopped a hopeful production company putting out a very detailed request that includes, and reveals, every one of Miss Miller’s impressive vital statistics. Specifics: Applicants must meet a strict criteria including measuring 5ft 6in, have a 25½in waist, a high hip of 35, low hip of 36½ and be prepared to cut their hair into a messy bob, so they look like Sienna Miller . Would-be Siennas hoping to appear in an advert for bottled water should be 5ft 6in in height and have a 25½in waist, the advert states. Their ‘low hip’ measurement should be 36½in while their ‘high hip’ should come in at 35in. Those afflicted with bingo wings will wince at Miss Miller’s ‘top arm’ circumference – a sparrow-like 10in. The casting request even gives details of the 33-year-old’s head and wrist circumferences. The hopeful extra must not have tattoos or body piercings and must be prepared to cut her hair into a messy bob, just like Miss Miller’s. And, if measuring up to these remarkable standards is not enough, the successful stand-in must also be an expert in yoga. According to the casting call, the advert, for Austrian water brand Vöslauer, will star Miss Miller and feature a group of girls ‘having a laugh while they perform very hard yoga moves in a private class’. The commercial ‘uses the effortless and feminine elegance of the girls to personify the true spirit of Vöslauer’. Flexible: On top of having the right measurements, applicants must be be able to do a host of yoga moves like the bridge (pictured) Sought-after position: Sienna Miller wannabees should be good at yoga stances including the scorpion . Moves: As well as having the right measurements and being prepared to chop their hair into a messy bob, applicants must also be able to do yoga moves including the side crow (left) and lotus (right) Candidates are required to demonstrate their yoga skills in the audition, with filming due to start in London shortly. Required yoga poses include the ‘side crow’, where the stand-in must balance on his or her forearms. The clones are also required to demonstrate the ‘bridge’, ‘lotus’, ‘warrior’, ‘wild thing’ and the ‘scorpion’, which sees the legs curl over the head in a potentially hospitalising move. The fee for the body double is set at just £500. Curiously, however, a separate casting call for the same advert, this time for a male yogi required to do the same moves but without looking like Miss Miller, sets the fee at £1,500. Vöslauer Water, Austria’s answer to Evian, bills itself as coming from the country’s ‘oldest fountain of youth’.

Barbara's magic bullet: Monica Lewinsky. Walters says that the former White House intern would be a 'run away success' on The View, a network source tells Daily Mail Online. She would attract great guests - even if casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would ever appear on the show again. Scroll down for video . Ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal Barbara Walters has always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years . Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern talked about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. 'Barbara believes that Monica, 41, could make The View competitive and compelling and while a lot of Washington's elite may scratch the show off its must-visit press list, the younger demographic of online users would tune in daily to see what she had to say,' added the source. Last year when discussing Lewinsky with David Letterman, he asked her about Monica joining The View. It looked as though the late night host was reading her mind and she stuttered, 'I think it would be great if she were on The View. I wouldn't expect it tomorrow.' 'Tomorrow is now,' says the insider. The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 with an original panel of women including Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It defied the odds previous shows faced in the 11am time slot. Exit Rosie: She had enough of The View and vice versa . Despite numerous cast changes – Lisa Ling, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy have had stints as co-hosts on the show – The View became a force to be reckoned with in daytime TV. But after the exit of Behar and Hasselbeck and the addition of McCarthy, The View took a ratings dive. ABC decided to overhaul the show following the end of that season, and replaced Shepherd and McCarthy with Republican analyst Nicolle Wallace and actress Rosie Perez. The network also brought back O'Donnell to join the show's long-running moderator, Whoopi Goldberg. In-fighting between Goldberg and O'Donnell and endless backstage turmoil caused ABC to move the show from its Entertainment division to its News division. Despite numerous set changes and multiple updates to the show opening, the new ensemble never seemed to attract viewers and ratings continued to fall. ABC then had a failed attempt at firing Perez while she was rehearing for her Broadway show Fish in the Dark in January. In February, after the return of Goldberg who had been sidelined with a back injury, ABC let O'Donnell go but allowed her to use her recent divorce as her excuse for departing the show for a second time. (She had a failed one-year stint as moderator in 2007 that abruptly ended after she walked off set following an on-air blow-up with co-host Hasselbeck.) Down to three co-hosts and two chairs vacant, ABC has been closely looking at Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams, fashion host Stacy London, former child star Raven Symone and comedienne Michelle Collins as potential replacements. President Bill Clinton appeared on The View in 2011 talking about his book Back to Work and the current economic troubles occurring in America. It is doubtful he would be a guest if Monica was co-host . The View celebratesd 4000 shows with guest co-hosts Barbara Walters and Joy Behar . The network is also seriously considering convincing former co-host Behar to return as a full-time panelist. She has made a half-dozen co-host appearances since January and was on-hand for the show's 4,000-episode celebration show. Walters, who sold all rights to The View back to ABC a year before her retirement in May 2014, has been contacting James Goldston, President of ABC News, and Ben Sherwood, President, Disney-ABC Television Group, trying to convince them to hire Lewinsky, insiders tell Daily Mail Online. Walters believes that Lewinsky could reignite interest in the show and after a decade-long silence; she has a lot to say. 'Barbara has been like a godmother to Monica ever since their infamous interview in 1999 following the Bill Clinton scandal. She's always believed Monica got the short end of the stick in the court of public opinion and has tirelessly defended her on the show over the years,' a source close to the show says. Barbara told Letterman, 'I like Monica. She never had a chance to move on,' the way Bill and Hillary did. 'She's an intelligent, nice woman.' Lewinsky recently participated in a 22-minute long TED Talk that has made international headlines. During the speech, the 41-year-old former White House intern spoke about 'The Price of Fame' and redefined her story as the first victim of cyber-bullying. Barbara Walters, arrives for the Oscar De La Renta fashion show last February. She remains spry and opinionated too. She's convinced Monica would help save the show . Not only that, but since re-emerging out of the shadows to address her affair with Clinton in a compelling Vanity Fair essay last May, she has taken on an extremely attractive new look to match her new persona. According to a representative of the show, Lewinsky has been asked to come on the show as a guest to discuss her anti-bullying campaign but is not on the list of potential co-hosts at this time. While current co-host Wallace would love to have Lewinsky as a regular on the show, staunch Democratic supporters and Clinton friends Goldberg and Perez aren't feeling the idea at all, the source revealed.

There's the elegant setting, VIP guests in tuxedos and designer gowns and a four-course meal served up by America's most famous kitchen. But don't get your hopes up. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. In his first six years, Obama held just seven state dinners and will hold at least two more this year: for the leaders of Japan, on April 28, and China, later in the year. Scroll down for video . Frugal entertainer: President Barack Obama (center) offers a toast on stage to French President Francois Hollande at the State Dinner on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington. Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. Obama hosted just seven . One of the lucky few: First lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama welcome French President Francois Hollande for a State Dinner at the North Portico of the White House in February 2014 . Truman, who became president in 1945, held six dinners during nearly eight years in office. Shrouded in pageantry, a White House state dinner is the highest diplomatic honour the U.S. reserves for allies and other countries. It's also one of the most lavish affairs the government puts on. The State Department pays the entire tab, which averaged about $500,000 each for Obama's seven dinners, said White House spokesman Patrick Ventrell. Ventrell and others said cost was a concern when Obama took office in January 2009 amid the worst economic slide since the 1930s. Officials were sensitive to the economic distress blanketing the country and were looking for other ways the president could cement relationships with foreign leaders without spending hundreds of thousands of public dollars on an opulent black-tie dinner. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honoring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honouring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (pictured, above with his wife Gursharan Kaur (far left) Other dinners included one for British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha in March 2012 . Barack Obama has held seven state dinners so far and plans at least two more this year. 2009: Then-Indian PM Manmohan Singh . 2010: Then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon . 2011: Then-Chinese President Hu Jintao . 2011: German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 2011: Then-South Korean President Lee Myung-bak . 2012: British Prime Minister David Cameron . 2014: French President Francois Hollande . 2015: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, scheduled for April 28 . 2015: Chinese President Xi Jinping . Later dinners were for Mexico, China, Germany, South Korea, Britain and France. Aides say Obama's overall level of engagement with foreign counterparts and the different ways he interacts with them is more important than the number of state dinners penciled on his calendar. 'State dinners are one tool of diplomacy that can be used and used effectively and sometimes we use them,' Ventrell said. Obama has met hundreds of times with his counterparts and other foreign officials in settings as formal as the Oval Office and as casual as a Hawaiian golf course. They also speak by phone. 'There's no concern that should be raised by the number of state dinners,' said Capricia Marshall, who led the State Department team that oversees visits by foreign dignitaries until she stepped down in 2013. Lyndon B. Johnson topped the 11 presidents who followed Truman, cramming 54 state dinners into his 62-month tenure in the Oval Office, White House Historical Association data show. Ronald Reagan, the actor-turned-politician who knew a thing or two about entertaining, held 52 dinners during two terms. Even Jimmy Carter, who liked to project an image of frugality, managed 28 state dinners in four years as president. A state dinner for a foreign leader marks the finale of a state visit, which opens with herald trumpets and cannon salutes on the South Lawn of the White House, followed by meetings, a joint news conference with the U.S. president and an elaborate State Department luncheon. Then comes the state dinner, where a tuxedo-clad president raises a glass and toasts relations between the countries in front of hundreds of invited guests, ranging from Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials to members of Congress, business leaders, celebrities and others, as well as the working media. President Gerald Ford dances with Queen Elizabeth during the state dinner in her honour in July 1976 . 'Make no mistake about it: every country wants to have a state visit,' said Ann Stock, a White House social secretary under President Bill Clinton. Obama and recent presidents have used multiple formats and settings apart from a state dinner to forge ties with their counterparts. In 2013, Obama met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands retreat in Southern California. Obama returned there the following year to consult with Jordan's King Abdullah II. Obama also took German Chancellor Angela Merkel to dinner at the upscale 1789 restaurant in Georgetown; French President Francois Hollande to the Virginia estate of Thomas Jefferson, a former president and former U.S. ambassador to France; and British Prime Minister David Cameron to an NCAA tournament game in Ohio. On Hawaii vacations, Obama has shared his golf game with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. George W. Bush welcomed more than a dozen foreign leaders to his Texas ranch, which became a popular venue for Bush's brand of casual diplomacy. He even treated then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to a tour of Graceland, the Memphis, Tennessee, home of Elvis Presley, one of Koizumi's musical idols. Reagan welcomed Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to his Santa Barbara, California, ranch. Richard Nixon received Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at his home in San Clemente, California. The origins of the state dinner were rooted in the the early 19th Century when they were held to honor the president's cabinet, Congress or other dignitaries, according to the White House Historical Association. At the time, the city consisted of a collection of isolated and separated villages that were almost inaaccessible, so large receptions or dinners were rare. It wasn't until the late 19th Century that the term state dinner referred specifically to a meal hosted by the president for a foreign head of state as the guest of honour. The first ruling monarch to attend a state dinner at the White House was King David Kalakaua of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 12, 1874.", "reference_summary": "Obama's record is lowest since Truman left office in 1953 having hosted six .

A teenage girl has told how she saved the life of a childhood friend who attempted suicide after months of bullying. Sophie Wilson, 17, performed CPR on Bradley Parkes after she and a friend found him hanging from a tree in the woods near his home in Willenhall, in Coventry. The 16-year-old was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital in a coma but yesterday his mother Tiffany, 35, revealed he had made a 'miracle' recovery, as she thanked the girls. Sophie and Katie Alwill, 18, raised the alarm and summoned help after they stumbled across the teenager during a woodland walk . 'Someone burned the rope free from the tree using a lighter,' said Miss Wilson. 'He wasn't breathing and his pulse was very weak. 'I learned CPR at school and I started doing chest compressions and mouth to mouth. 'He started breathing again but it was more snorting than breathing. 'I'm in shock and it still hasn't hit me that this actually happened. It feels like it isn't real.' Miss Wilson revealed how Bradley had grown up in the house opposite her and they went to primary school together. 'He's a really nice lad and I've never heard a bad word said about him. I didn't know he was being bullied. I don't think he told anyone.' Ms Parkes, a mother-of-five, told yesterday how her son was making progress. 'I can't thank those girls enough, I dread to think what would have happened if they hadn't found him,' she reportedly told the Mirror. The mother of schoolboy Bradley Parkes, 16, shared this picture saying: 'Hope all you b******s are happy my son is fighting for his life' after his suicide attempt . 'I thought he was going to die.' The mother-of-five shared a picture of her son in hospital last week and said he had been tormented for months by a gang. She described how her son had been robbed at knife point several times and was even slashed in the face. 'It all started in about August last year and Bradley has even been held at knifepoint,' she told the Coventry Telegraph. 'One time he was walking from one friend's house to another and this gang robbed all three of them. 'They even cut his face with a knife and told him not to tell people. He's even had his hand broken. 'Every time they see him they just take everything off him. People know all about this gang and they are arrested for all sorts.' The Manchester United fan was found unconscious in Willenhall Woods on Thursday last week. He had just passed his first course at Ernesford Grange School and was planning to go to college. His mother previously said: 'He left a suicide note saying he was taking his own life as it was easier than what he was going through.' Ms Parkes said the bullying escalated after Bradley gave a statement to the police about the gang, who are aged between 14 and 18. 'He's been called a grass and all sorts,' she said. Bradley was discovered hanging in the woods with a suicide note saying taking his own life was easier than what he was going through. He is now recovering from the ordeal . 'When he was held at knifepoint we decided enough was enough and went to the police. 'The other boy who was also robbed was too scared to make a statement, but Bradley wanted to. 'One of the gang members was charged and is now on remand in prison. He's up in court next month. 'They have smashed people's windows, vandalised people's homes and even set fire to someone using a deodorant can and a lighter. 'It left the person with burns on their stomach. Since that, all the grass stuff started and it made Bradley's life hell.' She slammed West Midlands Police for failing to take her repeated complaints seriously. 'I have gone to the police lots of times but it doesn't do anything. And not many people do go to the police as they are scared. I'm running out of options,' she said. West Midlands Police said they had launched and investigation into Bradley's attempt to end his life. Detective Chief Inspector Helen Kirkman said:'We recognise this is an emotive time for the school and the community. 'We are committed to finding out what may have led up to the boy taking such a sad decision and we continue to investigate offences that may have been committed against him. 'Anyone who may have any information that may assist our investigation should call us.

I’ve missed the whole experience.’ The classy ball striker has got all the tools to do well at Augusta and showed as much when he forced his way into contention on several occasions. The 37-year-old finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round. He then called a penalty shot on himself at the sixth after his ball moved a fraction when he addressed it with his putter. Casey finished sixth on his Masters debut in 2004 and actually led in 2007 after five holes of the final round . It’s a stupid rule that has subsequently been changed and Casey said, smiling:’It would be nice to wind the clock back, wouldn’t it? It did affect me for a few holes and I fell away (he finished 10th). But I’m going back a lot wiser and far better equipped if I got in contention again.’ Casey will wrap up his preparation at the Shell Houston Open, the site of his only PGA Tour victory. Also in the field are Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and a quartet of high class Americans in Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler and Phil Mickelson. Meanwhile, there’s still no word on whether Tiger Woods will play the Masters, although he did at least declare his intent by pitching up for a practice round at Augusta on Tuesday.", "reference_summary": "Paul Casey was the 99th qualifier in the field of 99 due to play at Augusta .

Clermont Auvergne’s former Bath full back ran amok as the Premiership champions were thrashed 37-5 — scoring one try from long range and having a crucial hand in two others, to claim the man-of-the-match award. Abendanon won the last of his two caps for England back in 2007, but he was still on the coaches’ radar until his move across the Channel last summer and, after a supreme display of elusive running, he admitted he has not given up on the slim possibility of a Test recall. Nick Abendanon breaks clear to score for Clermont in their thrashing of Northampton on Saturday . The English full back was man of the match for the third time against Premiership opposition this year . The 28-year-old is theoretically out of contention as an exile abroad, but he invoked the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause in the RFU selection policy as he said: ‘I’d love to get a call from Stuart (Lancaster) over the summer, but I’m not counting on it because they’ve got that rule in place. ‘I understood the reasons for the rule, and in my heart I knew that when I came to France my England career was probably over. But the World Cup . . . special dispensation . . . if Clermont continue the way they are, I stay injury-free and I keep playing some good rugby, then maybe it’s a possibility in the same way that people have been talking about Steffon (Armitage).’ Abendanon crosses in his starring performance for the French side in the European Champions Cup . A World Cup dispensation has been discussed for Toulon's English flanker Steffon Armitage . They have the squad to do anything, based on their efforts on Saturday night, when the Saints were brutally swept aside.

We’ve left our non-contact bibs in the changing-rooms. Humbled.’ Northampton captain Dylan Hartley (second right) leads the Saints off the field after their convincing defeat . Meanwhile Anthony Watson believes it is only a matter of time before Bath’s attacking intent delivers silverware after their 18-15 European Champions Cup quarter-final loss to Leinster in Dublin. Mike Ford’s men produced an impressive second-half comeback to leave the three-time champions hanging on by a thread at the end with full back Watson and fly-half George Ford especially impressive. ‘If anything, the way we played against Leinster adds more confidence because I thought there were times when we showed all we can do,’ Watson said. ‘I think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of and I have really enjoyed playing for this club.’", "reference_summary": "Nick Abendanon was man of the match in Clermont win over Northampton .

Lancaster has a speaking engagement a week today in aid of the Dallaglio Foundation along with Sir Clive Woodward, Lawrence Dallaglio and captain Chris Robshaw at a £225-a-head function.

THAT'S A BIT RICH, JIMMY . Jimmy Anderson being interviewed by cricket journalists on the eve of his 100th Test when he is just four wickets from becoming England's record Test bowler, was asked what advice he would give young bowlers starting their international careers. Anderson replied 'Ignore the media', which even if meant 'tongue in cheek', as he later claimed, was a pretty crass thing to say as someone who has benefited hugely over the years from money for newspaper columns. Meanwhile, captain Alastair Cook said he had learned of Kevin Pietersen's century yesterday from Test Match Special's Jonathan Agnew while being interviewed. Surely the ECB should have briefed him about KP's exploits — the elephant in the room — before his media duties. Jimmy Anderson was asked what advice he would give young bowlers and replied: 'Ignore the media' Cricket feuds don't always last as long as the 40-year enmity between Sir Ian Botham and Ian Chappell.

But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.", "reference_summary": "A psychology expert has revealed that the stress of a visit to the store can cause serious friction between couples .

Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said yesterday: 'It is definitely very warm for this time of year as it should be around 12C (54F).'

The unseasonably high temperatures last week saw highs of more than 25C (77F) in the South East - nearly double the average for this time of year. And forecasters warned that initial figures suggest that so far this month Britain has only seen 35 per cent of the average rainfall for April. The dry spell follows months of below-average rainfall and conditions are not expected to bring significant showers before May's arrival. Met Office meteorologist Emma Sillitoe said: ‘We are over halfway through the month but we've had around a third of the rainfall we get on average. ‘Over the next week temperatures are going to stay above average for most parts of the country, with the high pressure lasting until the weekend.’ Weather data for the year so far shows national rain fall has been significantly lower than average nearly every month. The year got off to a soggy start, with January seeing 20 per cent more rain than average but then 13 per cent less than usual fell in February. Last month the figure was 5 per cent below average.

Obama has argued with the progressive potentate Elizabeth Warren, calling her \"wrong\" on trade policy. The Massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom Hillary Clinton has been religiously prostrating. What everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of Democratic politics. Warren has publicly criticized so-called \"fast track\" trade authority that would allow the White House to negotiate massive, multination trade deals with little congressional oversight. The authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is modeled on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and has killed 700,000 American jobs and drove wages down in the United States while simultaneously decimating Mexican agriculture and small businesses. Aspects of the TPP deal would provide incentives for off-shoring jobs to low-wage countries, imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment, and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply don't like. In December, Warren wrote a letter signed by several other Democrats to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman raising concerns about the TPP. The letter warned that the TPP could erode safeguards that have been put in place to \"prevent future financial crises.\" \"We cannot afford a trade deal that undermines the government's ability to protect the American economy,\" Warren wrote. At a town hall with MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Tuesday, President Obama said, \"I love Elizabeth. We're allies on a whole host of issues. But she's wrong on this.\" Obama added, \"When you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong.\" But \"I'm right and she's wrong\" doesn't exactly come off as a thoughtful, let alone respectful, response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the Democratic Party today. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle. Clinton has recently courted Warren's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism. But according to a report by The New York Times, Clinton's staff is at pains to suggest that Clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend. Yet it becomes harder to paint Clinton as the \"original Elizabeth Warren\" each time she equivocates on trade policy and the TPP. In a 2012 speech as secretary of state, Clinton praised the TPP as \"the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" But now, as she campaigns for president facing a Democratic electorate divided over the deal, Clinton is sounding more critical. \"Any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\" Clinton said this week. So does Clinton support the TPP deal or not? Campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Clinton reportedly declined to say one way or the other. That's not the behavior of a fierce populist. It's more indicative of the sort of politically calculated, ideologically centrist \"triangulation\" for which her husband was famous. Seizing on Clinton's ambiguity, her potential challenger in the Democratic primary, Martin O'Malley, released a video this week making clear that he is against the TPP. According to a poll, as of 2012 just 1 in 4 Americans believed that NAFTA had benefited U.S. workers and only 1 in 3 believed it had benefited the U.S. economy overall. Even most Republicans in this poll supported the position that the United States should either \"renegotiate\" or \"leave\" NAFTA versus \"continue to be a member.\" In other words, any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding NAFTA. While it's not surprising that Republicans are siding with big business and against working Americans in supporting the TPP, it's befuddling that President Obama supports it. The only hope now is for 2016 Democratic candidates, especially Clinton at this point, to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is, for the most part, on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid minced no words in revealing his position about trade \"fast track\" authority: \"I'm not only no, I'm hell no.\" If Hillary Clinton wants to prove she's a real populist, now's her chance to be even more clear.", "reference_summary": "Sen.

Aueel Manyang, pictured here as a baby with her mother Akon Guode, believes her three siblings who died in the crash at a Melbourne lake were eaten by crocodiles in the water . Ms Guode visited her daughter for the first time but did not stay the night in the hospital. Mr Manyang said his daughter was expected to make a '100 per cent' recovery and she should be allowed to go home within four days. The five-year-old girl who survived when a car driven by her mother plunged into a lake believes her three siblings who died in the crash were eaten by crocodiles. Aluel Manyang believes her younger sister and two brothers died when they were taken by a crocodile because the children associate the giant reptiles with water. Her siblings - one-year-old brother Bol and four-year-old twins Madit and Anger - died after their mother Akon Guode crashed her 4WD into a lake at Wyndham Vale in Melbourne's outer west on Wednesday.

Ms Guode has been sent to stay with a relative after portraits of the deceased children and memories of them running around the family home became too much. 'She's very shocked,' Mr Manyang said. 'She was crying every 10 minutes. She remembers everything at home and how the kids were walking around and playing.' Mr Manyang says his partner told him she 'didn't feel herself' as she was driving and can only remember parts of the aftermath of the crash, The Age reports. But she does recall being in the water and hearing her surviving five-year-old daughter Awel saying 'Mama, the children are falling under the water'. Mr Manyang was struggling with the news his three young children had died. 'The feeling is very hard for me,' he said. 'My kids, they were very good ... always, they were happy. Especially the twins. It is a big shock to me to get this information.' He revealed Ms Guode called him at 2.16pm on Wednesday afternoon but by the time he returned the call there was no answer.

It comes as Mr Manyang defended the children's mother earlier on Thursday saying he didn't believe she caused the crash deliberately and said she was extremely distressed. 'She is a very good mother,' he told the Herald Sun. 'She loved the kids. She took care of the kids. I don't think she planned to do anything. 'I'm still believing she's innocent. 'My message to the community - because there is a lot of talking around, there is untruths - what I can tell them is they have to wait for the report from the police investigation, that will be the truth.' He made an emotional visit to the crash site on Thursday where floral tributes were starting to build up from the Sudanese community who knew the family and from strangers. Ms Guode, who is the mother of seven children, came to Melbourne from South Sudan to escape war after her first husband died. The children's mother, Akorn Manang, was behind the wheel of grey 2005 Toyota Kluger when it plunged into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . Police have retrieved the four-wheel-drive after it was plunged into the Wyndham Vale on Wednesday . Mourners pray at a makeshift shrine at the scene where a 4WD was submerged in Lake Gladman . Mr Manyang's 16-year-old niece, Amani Alier, said the family were trying to console him following the devastating news. 'He's shattered, he couldn't stop crying, his nose was bleeding,' she said. 'He just dropped when he saw a picture of his son on the wall. It's so hard for him to deal with. He loved those kids.' It follows as the four-wheel-drive was removed from the lake on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children. 'It's a shock for everyone,' Mr Kok said, according to the Herald Sun. 'We spent all night at hospital until 3 in the morning.' It comes as the tight-knit Sudanese community and nearby residents started leaving floral tributes for the three children. 'As soon as I saw the community coming towards this scene where the incident's happened, it's making me feel like people care,' Mr Kok said.

Thomas Kok, the cousin of the children's father, who spent the night at the children's hospital with Awel, visited the crash site on Thursday morning to pay tribute to the children . Police have confirmed the mother is assisting the homicide squad with their investigation as they appealed for members of the Sudanese community to come forward if they knew anything about what was going on in the family's life. 'We need to understand what led to this, we need to understand the background of this family, we need to understand what was happening in their lives,' Superintendent Stuart Bateson said. 'Hopefully this will lead to a greater understanding of what led to this incident. We appeal especially to the Sudanese community who might know what was happening in this family's life, what their movements were before this tragedy.' A witness Michelle relived the tragic moment the car ploughed into the lake on Thursday morning. 'It is still in my mind now, every time you close your eyes you just see someone so little,' she told Nine News in tears. 'My heart goes out to the family and to everybody who witnessed it. 'Those rescuers, those workers, when it was winding down it was just devastating seeing them sitting in the gutter.' Michelle told 3AW late on Wednesday that her friend Travis rescued one of the young boys from the vehicle. 'Travis jumped into the water and smashed the back windscreen and got one little boy out. (Emergency workers) then started working on the child,' she said. 'I only saw three get taken out. I believe they were travelling down the boulevard...and they've just gone over and into the lake.' Emotions were still raw on Thursday morning for neighbour Michelle who witnessed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger plunging into the lake on Manor Lakes Boulevard . The search and rescue team remained at the scene to try and pull the car from the water, which is reportedly about 20 to 30 metres from shore . Locals are shocked as to how the car was able to get into the centre of the lake as it is 'pretty far from the road' Detective from the Homicide Squad and the Major Collision Investigation Unit have spoken to some witnesses but they are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. It is not yet know if it was a deliberate act or an accident, according to police. It's believed the grey 2005 Toyota Kluger 4WD was travelling towards Pedder St and Minindee Road when the incident occurred. Police particularly wish to speak to anyone who saw the car between 3.30 and 3.45pm. Witnesses or anyone with further information about the incident should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Her presence at the games did not go unnoticed. Wide receiver Dwayne Bowe would kiss her at every game, and former return specialist and wide receiver Dante Hall took off his coat and gave it to her, Susan Johnson said.

A midwife has won a decade-long battle to give mothers more time attached to their newborns before the umbilical cord is cut. Amanda Burleigh was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery – shutting off the blood supply from the placenta – was wrong. Since the 1950s, when doctors and midwives started giving women a hormonal injection to reduce the risk of haemorrhage, they have clamped the cord within seconds of birth. They feared the drug – since replaced with a safer substitute – could harm the baby. But Ms Burleigh, a midwife at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still visibly pulsating with blood. She said: ‘One day I had a brainwave and thought, “We all clamp the cord within seconds of the baby being born, but we are doing it without any evidence about whether it’s good or bad for the baby.”' She contacted other medics, including obstetrician Dr David Hutchon, and together the group amassed evidence that stopping the blood flow so early could be harmful. One study showed immediate cord-clamping could deprive a baby of a third of its blood stock – enough to fill a medium-size wine glass. In particular, they found the practice raised the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. A tenth of all toddlers are anaemic, which is linked to delays in learning, speaking and understanding. There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies. They have finally succeeded in getting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to change its guidelines. NICE now states that doctors and midwives should not routinely clamp the cord ‘earlier than one minute from the birth of the baby’. The cord should be clamped within five minutes, but left longer if the mother requests. Besides the medical benefits, the change means mothers get the chance to hold their babies for a moment while still connected to them. Ms Burleigh, a midwife for 26 years, said she had to overcome persistent doubts from colleagues, who asked who she was to query medical protocol. ‘There was quite a lot of resistance from both doctors and midwives,’ she said. ‘At times I felt like a whistleblower.’ There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies . However, she said she felt a ‘moral duty’ to challenge a practice that was not grounded in evidence. Dr Hutchon, now retired, said hospitals had blindly clamped and cut within seconds of birth for decades. He said: ‘We didn’t notice we were doing any harm because we were doing it to every baby.’ He became interested in 2003 after hearing that more premature babies survived when the cord was not cut early. But he said there was ‘continual resistance to change’ – with some doctors refusing delayed cord-clamping even today. Some still believed the theory that immediate clamping reduced the risk of mothers haemorrhaging, Dr Hutchon said, even though a 2013 study found it made no difference. Ms Burleigh, recently named Midwife of the Year by the British Journal Of Midwifery, added: ‘In 20 or 30 years I think we will look back on immediate cord-clamping and think, “What were we doing? We dropped an absolute clanger.\"' A spokesman for NICE said that its advice on care during childbirth was reviewed ‘at regular intervals’.", "reference_summary": "Amanda Burleigh was convinced clamping cord immediately was wrong .

Ella May Rudd points to the leak on her Hummer H2 that she was trying to have repaired at a Maaco auto body shop in Haggerstown, Maryland, before co-owner Kyle Kandrick left a threatening voicemail for her husband . 'So I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' 'I did everything I could for her. She was in here Saturday and I explained everything to her the right way, and I don't like being attacked on Facebook.' 'I'm telling your right now: deal with it before I deal with it.' On her post, Rudd wrote that she had been dealing with the auto body shop for 'the last two months' while trying to repair a leak on her Hummer H2. She said that the voicemail was in response to a scathing review she had written on the company's Facebook page after her tenth unsuccessful trip to Maaco. 'Crooks, rude people, and liars. Please take your business anywhere else but here. I regret spending the last month and a half wasting my time with this company,' she wrote in the review. 'My car is still not fixed. They have charged me for car parts not needed, they have had me show up to multiple appointments and not have mechanics/car ready, they have lied about multiple car repair events.' 'They are extremely unprofessional, and so much more. I hope this review at least stops a few people from being robbed and aggravated. So disappointed.' Rudd said that she paid Kandrick a visit on Saturday when she found out her car had still not been repaired. Kandrick called Rudd's husband after she left a scathing review on the shop's Facebook page. In the voicemail he said: 'I want you to get her in check before there is a big f***ing problem here on my end. Understand me?' Kandrick was suspended after Rudd posted the voicemail on Facebook and the post quickly went viral . She said that Kandrick was 'really rude' and blamed his workers. Rudd said she demanded she be returned the money she had been charged. 'I don't care whose fault it is,' she said she told him. 'It is your business that messed up and I need your business to fix it and to return my money that they just took.' She said Kandrick then claimed the shop didn't repair leaks, only to ask her to bring the car in again when a mechanic walked in and said the leak would be an 'easy fix'. Rudd said Kandrick also 'stormed out' of the room at one point and was talking to her 'like I was the biggest idiot ever'. The stay-at-home mother of two calls herself a 'strong woman', who had no problem confronting Kandrick herself after hearing the voicemail. 'I said to him, \"My husband will not handle me at all.\"' Rudd said Maaco President Jose Costa called her Thursday, the day after she posted the recording, and said he couldn't fire the employee because he's a co-owner of the franchise. Maaco officials didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about that call. The company apologized to Rudd in a statement issued on Friday and said the 'employee at issue' would be suspended pending further review. Maaco added that he would be getting diversity and anger management training and that the shop would be temporarily closed 'in order to pursue customer care training for the team'. Rudd said the company has also offered to repair her car, but she's not interested. 'Maaco will not touch my car now,' she said.

According to new research, 61 per cent of US adults have admitted that they don't extend invitations to friends and family because of their 'home shame'. General mess, dated carpets and kitchens, unfinished DIY projects and the small size of their property rank highest on the list of embarrassments - which awful color schemes, shabby furniture and poor location also proved to be particularly shameful for homeowners. Shame: More than 60 per cent of Americans have admitted to being ashamed of their own homes . In a study of 1,000 people for Sugru, makers of moldable glue, 48 per cent said their embarrassment about their home is usually confined to just a few rooms or areas, however 33 per cent acknowledge they are ashamed of their whole house. 1.Mess . 2. Dated carpets . 3. Dated kitchen . 4. Dirty/stained carpets . 5. DIY jobs that haven't been started . 6. Bad smells . 7. Size . 8. Cracked walls/ceilings . 9. Badly decorated . 10. Faded or peeling paint . 11. Old/broken furniture . 12. Patchy lawn . 13. Too much clutter or trash . 14. Incomplete DIY jobs . 15. Bad/anti-social neighbors . 16. Dated/shabby wall paper . 17. Overgrown yard . 18. Mold or mildew patches . 19. Bad location . 20. Bold/garish color schemes . More than half haven't let visitors in to certain rooms, and 36 per cent steer people away from coming to visit altogether. Interestingly, more than half of the participants (54 per cent) admitted that it is their friends whom they try to avoid inviting over, while 38 per cent were more concerned about having strangers visit their humble abodes; 33 per cent on the other hand are most concerned about work colleagues taking a peek at their home. Top on the list of cringe-worthy rooms is the living room, followed by the kitchen, bedrooms and bathrooms. What's worse, 62 per cent worry they will never get their home to the point where they are no longer ashamed by it. Sugru spokeswoman Jane ni Dhulchaointigh said of the survey: 'When you first move into a house, most people have ideas about how they want to make it their ideal home. 'But a lack of time, money and even basic DIY skills can mean many struggle to see all, or even any of these plans through. 'Sometimes all it takes are a few minor changes here and there. Start small with a DIY project that you're going to actually enjoy, with simple tools that you're confident using and focus on one room at a time. 'The pride that you'll get from one successful project will help spur you straight on to the next.' According to the survey, a whopping 30 per cent of people have actually pretended to be out when someone they knew knocked on their door, and 14 per cent admit that they have had someone drop them off elsewhere rather than allowing them to see their home. A further 39 per cent, at one point or another, have avoided hosting an event at their home. Nearly a quarter of people surveyed (21 per cent) also admit to ending a date early rather than inviting their date back to their home. Envy: Many Americans confessed that they would love the chance to take a look inside the Obama family's private living area . LIfestyle guru: Martha Stewart's home topped the list of celebrities houses people would most like to see inside . The study found that 63 per cent have plans to improve their home, with 18 per cent saying the motivation for getting it done is based on pure embarrassment. Other motivators for wanting to work on their home include time off from work, upcoming visits from family and friends and looking at homes on TV. 1. Martha Stewart . 2. The Obamas' living quarters in the White House . 3. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie . 4. Jennifer Aniston . 5. Oprah Winfrey . 6. George Clooney/Lake Como . 7. Taylor Swift . 8. Ellen Degeneres and Portia De Rossi . 9. The Playboy Mansion . 10. Madonna . And when it comes to celebrity home envy, it was lifestyle guru Martha Stewart's home that topped the list of houses the participants would most like to see, while the Obamas' living area in the White House and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's home placed second and third respectively. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 46 per cent of respondents admitted that they are struggling to make the changes they would like to their home because it costs too much money, while 23 per cent say they're not making improvements because they are planning to move soon. 16 per cent admit they don't know how to fix or repair what needs to be fixed to make their homes look presentable. An overwhelming 88 per cent would feel less embarrassed about the state of their home if they could redecorate all or part of their home, or at least get those pesky DIY jobs done. Ms ni Dhulchaointigh adds, 'We are all busy, which often leaves less time to pay attention to those small home improvement jobs. 'That's why we've created something that makes quick fixes, repairs and improvements easy. It's all about making people's lives simpler and getting that home pride back.", "reference_summary": "Many people also confessed that they would love to take a tour of lifestyle Martha Stewart's home, as well as the Obamas' private living area .", "edited_summary": "Many people also confessed that they would love to take a tour of lifestyle Martha Stewart's home, as well as the Obamas' public living area .", "error_type": "Extrinsic Entity", "scores": {"QAFactEval_edited": 0.1467315905, "CoCo_edited": 0.21646677, "DAE_edited": 0.46699214, "FactCC_edited": 0.0026617, "QuestEval_edited": 0.2463538966, "SummaC_edited": 0.2909238636, "Q2_edited": 0.0, "BLEURT_edited": 0.3682390451, "BLEU_edited": 3.64e-15, "BERTScore_edited": 0.5611318946, "BARTScore_edited": 0.453534334, "ROUGE-2_edited": 0.44, "QAFactEval_reference": 0.416309069, "CoCo_reference": 0.23624481, "DAE_reference": 0.48338175, "FactCC_reference": 0.00285447, "QuestEval_reference": 0.2448039031, "SummaC_reference": 0.2909238636, "Q2_reference": 0.0, "BLEURT_reference": 0.3743700683, "BLEU_reference": 4.32e-15, "BERTScore_reference": 0.545688808, "BARTScore_reference": 0.5038414043, "ROUGE-2_reference": 0.48}}, {"id": 81, "article_id": 1955, "article": "Late goals, a famous overhead kick and a rare Paul Scholes header are all included in Wayne Rooney's top five derby days moments ahead of Sunday's crucial clash. The two sides are locked in a battle with Arsenal for the second automatic Champions League qualification place and neither side know that a defeat could see them slip out of contention. Listed on his website, the Manchester United striker spoke about his most memorable moments, which included FOUR stoppage time winners. Wayne Rooney (right) has listed his five most memorable moments of the Manchester derby . 1) Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City, February 2011, Rooney overhead kick . Sir Alex Ferguson's side recorded a crucial win over their city rivals in the race for the Premier League back in 2011,and Rooney's spectacular overhead kick cemented his place in United folklore when it flew into the top corner past the helpless Joe Hart. The England striker couldn't quite believe that had happened at full-time: 'It was a massive game for both teams and to score in that way was something I will never forget, the feeling was unbelievable. 'I knew Nani was going to cross it so I was getting ready for an header, then it took a little deflection and come behind me, I never really had time to think and just tried the overhead and thankfully it went in the top corner.' The England captain scored a spectacular overhead kick to win the derby and keep their title hopes alive . 2) Manchester United 4-3 Manchester City, September 2009, Michael Owen 96 minute winner . In a ding-dong game at Old Trafford, Craig Bellamy scored a late equaliser for the visitors, as the home fans fell silent but with virtually the last kick of the game, Ryan Giggs found Michael Owen, who slotted home past the on-rushing Shay Given. Rooney says it's a game he'll never forget: 'It was end to end for a lot of the game and when Craig Bellamy equalised in the 90th minute everyone thought that was it, so when Michael Owen scored in the last few seconds it was an unbelievable moment for both Michael and the team and it's certainly a moment I will never forget.' Michael Owen (right) scored a 96 minute winner not long after Craig Bellamy had equalised for the visitors . 3) Manchester United 3-1 Manchester City, January 2010, Rooney sends his side to Wembley . Former United striker Carlos Tevez looked like he'd sent the Carling Cup semi-final into extra-time after cancelling out goals from Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick, but Rooney had other ideas, when he headed home a stoppage time goal and send his side to Wembley. Rooney said: 'To score the decisive goal late on in any game is a special feeling for any player, but to do it in a derby and to send your team into a final makes it even better.' Rooney scored a stoppage time winner to send United through to the Carling Cup final at Wembley . 4) Manchester City 0-1 Manchester United, April 2010, Scholes heads home last-gasp goal . The midfield maestro's rare header was the third stoppage time goal United had scored against their rivals in that season, as they kept their title hopes alive in a game they couldn't afford to slip-up, which is why Rooney ranks this goal as one of the most important. He said: 'Paul Scholes's header was vital for us that season and kept us in the title race. At that stage of the season every game is massive, especially when you need to win, so for something like that to happen just when you think the game is coming to an end is incredible.' Paul Scholes headed home an injury time to keep his side in the hunt for the Premier League title . 5) Manchester City 2-3 Manchester United, December 2012, Van Persie stoppage time free-kick . United's big signing of the season, Robin van Persie, proved his worth when he fired home a free-kick from the edge of the box for another stoppage time winner, putting Rooney and co six points clear at the top of the Premier League table. 'This was a massive game, they came to Old Trafford as the champions, said Rooney. 'So for Robin to score the winner late on and take us 6 points clear at the top of the table was very important'. Robin van Persie's deflected free-kick put United six points clear at the top on their to winning the league .", "reference_summary": "Wayne Rooney listed his five most memorable moments of the derby .

A little more than a month before her husband, Bernard Freundel, is set to be sentenced for his crimes, his wife Sharon Freundel held a lecture at a Maryland Jewish school about how to respond to traumatic experiences. While Mrs Freundel did not directly address her personal drama, she did allude to the scandal which shocked her community at the beginning of the talk. 'As you all know, I've become an expert in PTSD,' Mrs Freundel told the room of about 150 people, according to the Washington Post. 'Researching this has been so therapeutic.' Sharon Fruendel (right), wife of disgraced D.C. Rabbi Bernard 'Barry' Freundel (left) gave a speech on March 22 which alludes to her family's recent scandal. In October, her husband was charged with spying on dozens of women who changed in their synagogue's ritual bathroom . It was in October that Sharon's husband Bernard 'Barry' Freundel was arrested after a police investigation revealed he had spied on dozens of women who changed in the ritual mikvah bathrooms at the Kesher Israel Congregation synagogue in D.C. Freundel first came under investigation when a woman changing came across a suspicious clock radio in the bathroom which is used mainly by people converting to Judaism and Jewish women to cleanse following menstruation. In February, the 63-year-old rabbi pleaded guilty to 52 misdemeanor charges of voyerism and he is set to be sentenced on May 15. In the weeks following her husband's arrest, Freundel left D.C. for Maryland, where one of her daughter's lived. While her husband has granted her a Jewish divorce, the two are still legally married. On March 22, she spoke to the group fathered at Charles E Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Maryland, for about 90 minutes. During the talk she cited several instances of 'trauma' in the Hebrew bible and how the biblical figures responded to their crises as lessons for life. She seemed to address her own personal issues with her husband when she quoted Jewish philosopher Joseph Soloveitchik, who wrote that marriage is a place people can go 'when we believed nobody 'gets' us.' Barry Freundel pleaded guilty to 52 counts of misdemeanor voyeurism in February. He is set to be sentenced in May. Pictured above leaving D.C. Superior court on February 19 . However, Soloveitchik ends by saying that ultimately, the answer 'is to turn to the one above. The one above will get it.' Several members of the Kesher community were in attendance to hear Freundel talk, and respected her more for it. 'She didn't want to represent the scandal anymore,' one longtime Kesher member told the Post. 'It gave her sense of how she survived it and how the community can survive it. She was educating the community in surviving its misfortune.' Mrs Freundel is also the director of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at the Jewish Primary Day School in northwest D.C. Prosecutors said Freundel recorded the women between early 2009 and October 2014 using devices installed in two changing rooms for the National Capital Mikvah, which is next to the Kesher synagogue. Investigators found six video files of nude women, with one showing Freundel's face as he set up the camera, prosecutors said. Police searched his home and his office at Maryland's Towson University, where he was an associate professor, and seized computers, electronic devices, remote controls, hard drives and cameras hidden in a fan and a tissue box, they said. Prosecutors said at least 52 women were recorded nude or partially nude on 25 different dates from March 2012 to September 2014. Voyeurism carries a three-year statute of limitations. Investigators also found that Freundel secretly recorded about 100 more women between 2009 and September 2014 in a bathroom at the National Capital Mikvah, they said. Each of the 52 counts of voyeurism carries a penalty of a year in prison and/or a fine of up to $1,000, or $2,500 for those committed after June 2013. One of the victims, Stephanie Doucette, said in a statement: 'I continue to be profoundly shocked and upset by Rabbi Freundel's outrageous conduct, which violated the security, trust and beliefs of so many women.' Freundel is also facing civil lawsuits and was fired from Kesher Israel in December.

'When I look back at the tape, I can see her head bounce off the concrete because when he threw her down, she wasn't able to brace herself,' the man told KVUE. 'She was absolutely unconscious. 'There were a couple of other gentleman in the store with me and we were saying 'is she breathing?' 'Because at first we weren't seeing her stomach rise and fall.' Another witness, Viviana Garcia, said she thought the woman had died. Furthermore, the woman's daughter, who is six-years-old, also saw the incident unfold. 'It looked like she was dead,' Garcia told the network. 'The little girl was screaming, ''Mommy, mommy''.' Dash cam: A second roll of footage was captured inside Johnson's car showing Keith being arrested . Resisting?: Johnson claimed that Keith resisted him and that he was forced to take her down . Slam: This is the moment officer Ben Johnson throws Viviana Keith to the ground during the arrest Tuesday . Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said the calls his department received about Keith said she was being 'very combative, very argumentative and also very intoxicated'. Callers also said that Keith had left her daughter in the car. They said she was driving 'erratic' and 'carelessly' when she arrived. Others claimed to have spoken to the daughter, who said she was hungry. Internal investigation: Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks says he has reviewed the footage and believes Johnson acted within his rights . After seeing the footage, Banks said he thinks the officer acted in the right way. 'The officer was very professional, was talking to her calm, he wasn't excited, he wasn't angry,' Banks told KVUE. 'It's unfortunate, the fact that this lady did what appears to hit her head and was knocked unconscious, but I'll tell you, the officer did what he was supposed to do in a situation like that.' Keith was arrested and charged with DWI with a child younger than 15 and interfering with pubic duties. She is being kept at Williamson County Jail for the time being.

The innovative spherical map of galaxy superclusters is the most complete picture of our cosmic neighbourhood to date. It will help astrophysicists understand how matter is distributed in the universe and provide key insights into dark matter – one of physics' greatest mysteries. Scroll down for video . A slice through the 3D Map of the nearby Universe. Our Milky Way galaxy is in the centre, marked by a cross. The map spans nearly two billion light years from side to side. Regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red, whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue. The lighter blue and white areas on the map represent greater concentrations of galaxies. The red area is the supercluster called the Shapley Concentration, the largest collection of galaxies in the nearby universe. Unexplored areas are marked in uniform medium blue. Professor Michael Hudson, Jonathan Carrick and Stephen Turnbull, of Waterloo's Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Guilhem Lavaux of the Institute d'Astrophysique de Paris of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique of France, created the map. Published online in the peer-review journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society — one of the world's leading primary research journals for astronomy and astrophysics, knowing the location and motion of matter in the universe will help astrophysicists predict the universe's expansion and identify where, and how much dark matter exists. Dark matter accounts for a large majority of the mass content in the universe. It is a hypothesized form of matter particle that does not reflect or emit light and as a result it can't be seen or measured directly. The existence and properties of dark matter can only be inferred indirectly through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light. 'A better understanding of dark matter is central to understanding the formation of galaxies and the structures they live in such as galaxy clusters, superclusters and voids,' said Hudson. Scientists have observed that galaxies move more than can be accounted for by the universe's expansion. These discrepancies are called peculiar velocities. For example, our own Milky Way galaxy and its neighbour Andromeda are moving with a speed of 2 million km/hr. Previous models haven't fully accounted for this observed motion. Hudson and his team are interested in discovering what structures are responsible for the peculiar velocities. These deviations in the motion of galaxies are a valuable tool to determine the distribution of matter and dark matter on the largest scales. The next step is to get better maps and better samples of peculiar velocities to compare with our maps, the team say. They also created a video shows a 3D Map of the nearby Universe. The volume mapped is roughly circular, so it's a bit like slicing an orange vertically from the edge through to the opposite edge. The location of our Milky Way Galaxy is in the centre of the middle frame (marked SGZ=0) halfway through the movie. The map spans nearly two billion light year from side to side. Regions with many galaxies are shown in white or red, whereas regions with fewer galaxies are dark blue. It shows the density field smoothed with a Gaussian window of 4 Mpc/h.", "reference_summary": "Map spans nearly two billion light years .

Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, regularly makes videos and posts on social media about life in the so-called Islamic State under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. Last month he complained about peeling potatoes and his troubles with washing his clothes. In his latest video the former Morrisons security guard, who used to live at home with his mother and has not managed to get himself a jihadi bride, accuses a fellow 'brother' of running away from the frontline in Syria 'When it was only him and me defending the post'. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, posts videos online under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. He has complained about jihadis who leave their posts then boasting on social media about their bravery . Islamic State fighters pose at the border between Syria and Iraq. Hussain has cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters . A jihadi poses with a handgun and an ISIS ring in a social media post. Hussain has warned would-be jihadi brides to be wary of fighters who seem to spend too much time online . He said: 'I can recall myself shouting at him to come back as he ran away leaving me alone to defend the position. 'The ironical thing here was that the brother went online the next day and praised how Dawlah [Islamic State] managed to defend an onslaught by the enemy, and how people in the west need to \"stop being cowards\". 'On other occasions, I have noticed how some brothers praise how \"we\" attacked such and such village, how hard the battle was for \"us\", etc. yet they were not there. 'A form of tadlees (twisting the haqq [truth] to get self praise), not a characteristic stemming from humbleness and sincerity.' Hussain, who has previously issued advice on how jihadists should 'deal' with wannabe jihadi brides, has now cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters. He said: 'Although there may be nothing wrong with marrying a brother who is constantly online, I would just like to say that its best one does not rush into a marriage contract. 'I have been in Sham [the Caliphate] for just over a year now and I have seen many beautiful brothers who are constant on their ibaadah [worship], warriors in front lines, have amazing military minds, generous towards others, humble, funny, etc. yet are unknown on social media. 'So sisters, please be careful and deliberate when choosing a spouse. We are still human beings, we err and we make mistakes. 'Some people's intentions can sidetrack, especially when on social media platforms.' A jihadi poses with an AK-47 and a handgun. Some fighters boast online about how 'we' attacked a village when they weren't even part of any ISIS assault, according to Hussein . Despite his hatred of the West this ISIS fighter enjoys showing off his Adidas trainers in this online post . Hussain himself poses with an AK-47 in Raqqa, Syria. He often posts videos containing his opinions on life inside the so-called Islamic State . The British jihadi decries boastful fellow fighters who are 'always on twitter posting pics of [themselves]' rather than actually fighting on the frontline - which should make would-be wives wary given electronic devices are banned there. He adds: 'The only reason a brother can be constantly on twitter, fb, Instagram or other social media platform, is if he's not on front lines.' Hussain continues that all ISIS members in the area controlled by the group have guns and not just the fighters. 'Just because someone is in Sham and has a gun, it does not mean they are a Mujaahid,' he says. 'Immaturity makes a person over excited. And being over excited leads to posting pics online with a gun. 'Do not be afraid to reject a proposal, there are many brothers here in Sham. And some of the most beautiful are those who are always on ribat [the frontline] and completely unknown on social media platforms.' And in a missive posted yesterday Hussain railed against jihadis who moan 'like menstruating women' about the guns they've been given. Jihadists based in Atmeh - just one mile from the Olive Tree refugee camp in Syria - have boasted of living 'the goodly life' in a huge hilltop villa - a far cry from the frontline in the country's brutal civil war . Bethnal Green teenagers Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase all ran away from their homes apparently to be jihadi brides. Hussain says such girls should chose their husbands carefully . It is feared the three are now married to ISIS fighters. Hussain has complained at how some moan like 'menstruating women' at the guns they have been given . Hussain admits on Twitter that it took him 50 minutes to peel 10 potatoes - leaving him too tired to cut them . He says to his 'beloved brothers in Islam': 'Know that yesterday you had nothing of honor in your hands and were subjugated under the laws of the Kuffar [unbeliever] . 'You carried no bullets, no gun, no grenade, nothing of this sort. Yet here you are today with honor given to you, so do not boast about what you have been given. 'For you have been given it due to the sacrifices of your brothers before you…The soldiers who fought the battles while you were sitting at home. 'Likewise, do not complain when you are given a gun which you do not like… What were you walking around with last month? In Dar Al-Kufr [any non-Muslim country], did you have a brand new Russian AK47? 'Did you have a Glock? You didn’t even have a rusty old gun, yet here you are complaining like a menstruating woman about the very find details of your gun!' Yet Hussain has form when it comes to spending a time posting on social media rather than taking the fight to ISIS' Syrian government or Kurdish enemies or dodging US airstrikes - and he's not averse to sharing pictures of himself brandishing an AK-47 either. Earlier this month he complained on Twitter about his difficulties completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes. In August Last August he appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'", "reference_summary": "Omar Hussain, from High Wycombe, often posts about life in Islamic State . 27-year-old moans of one jihadi who left him on his own to defend position .

Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, as they made dinner inside their mobile home in Hudson, Florida last week - before shooting his older brother in the leg and then taking his own life. The injured brother, 16-year-old Trevor, attended the boys' funeral at St. James the Apostle Catholic Church in a wheelchair on Wednesday, while his divorced parents, Helen Campochiaro and Luis Pimentel, were seen receiving hugs from well-wishers before the service. As many as 400 people attended the memorial for the boys, who would've celebrated their birthdays this week; Kevin would have turned 13 on Monday and Brady would have turned seven on Friday, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Loss: Kevin Pimentel, 12, (left) shot dead his six-year-old brother, Brady, (right) before taking his own life in their Florida home as they made dinner last week. The two boys were laid to rest on Thursday . Mourners leave the funeral in Port Richey, Florida as the boys' older brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, who was shot in the leg in the incident, is helped into a waiting limo. The three boys had been home alone at the time . At the service, the Reverend Mike Cormier said the boys were now 'at the world's greatest sleepover'. The youngsters died while they were home with their 16-year-old brother. Their mother, who works two jobs to keep the family afloat, and another brother, 18, were not home at the time. Officials said there was no argument or incident that sparked the gunfire. According to a statement the Pasco County Sheriff's Office released on Thursday, Kevin was making dinner in the family's home and asked his older brother, Trevor, to help. Using a gun kept on the top shelf in a closet area of the family's mobile home, Kevin then shot Brady in Brady's room, Trevor told police. After wounding his older brother in the leg, he then turned the gun on himself. The deaths came just one day after their mother, 38, set up an account on gofundme, appealing for support for her family. On the page, she explained she had been left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks. Grief-stricken: The boys' mother Helen Campochiaro is pictured with Kevin (center) and Brady (right). The single mother to four boys was at one of her two jobs at the time of the shootings . Remembered: Flowers and pictures of the boys were displayed inside St. James the Apostle Catholic Church . 'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said the day after the boys died. Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting. Campochiaro is a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys and after the car crash, she didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said. On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress. Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind. 'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 'She just had it (a gun) for protection.' Victims: Six-year-old Brady (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor, 16 (right), was shot in the leg . The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he didn't know his ex-wife, from whom he separated in 2012, kept a weapon in the home. In an interview with Fox13, he said that he had noticed Kevin was becoming withdrawn and no longer wanted to take part in family activities. He said he saw him getting angry at Brady over small things. 'I didn't get into it with Kevin,' he said. 'I didn't want to have any confrontation with him. I let him do what he wanted to do. I should have maybe disciplined him a little more.' He said the boys would spend half of their time with him and he always looked forward to their visits. 'I miss them very much,' he said. 'I love them. I will never forget them. They were my life.' Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons. Anger: The boys' father, Luis Pimentel, said he had noticed Kevin getting angrier and more withdrawn . Scene: The shooting unfolded in the family's mobile home at the Sugar Lane park mobile home in Hudson . 'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' she wrote on the gofundme page. 'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.' Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked. 'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote. 'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.' The page has raised nearly $7,000. Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received more than $13,000 in donations. 'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro. 'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'

On a catwalk show which took place in Xi'an, the capital city of north-western China's Shaanxi province, models strutted their stuff in items made from the precious metal. Including underwear and a chain-mail style shirt which it has been revealed would be worth around £40,000. And this was no lightweight affair either. On a catwalk in Xi'an in China models strutted their stuff in gold underwear, it is thought the look is influenced by royal women in history . The shirt alone worn by the male model weighed in at 7lbs and the matching bra and underwear for the female model also came in at 7lbs. The idea for real gold clothing takes its inspiration from royal women in history, including Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Tsarina Alexandra who all reportedly had gold clothing. The organisers of the event said that it took 30 craftsmen three months to make the gold shirt and the women's clothing which is also worth around £40,000. Fashion photographer Manchu Peng, 30, who attended event said: 'There were some good designs there but the gold clothing items really stole the show.' It took 30 craftsmen three month to make this shirt which is mean out of real gold and has a chain-mail style . The model showed off his shirt as on-lookers checked out how the design was made . The idea came after a Chinese designer unveiled an extraordinary set of underwear made entirely of gold last year. The items however were produced as a work of art and not intended for sale. They were modelled by an unnamed woman who was joined by two other models - both of whom posed with glittering gold accessories, including necklaces, a shoe and a rabbit at a store in China. These two women proudly showed off their gold underwear, the items are not for sale but are said to be worth around £40,000 . This gold underwear set has an intricate design with the model wearing a pair of white pants underneath it to protect her modesty . And prior to that a Turkish jeweller unveiled a series glamorous gold dresses - each worth a staggering £85,000. Artisan Ahmet Atakan, based in Izmir, a city in Turkey, crafted each frock out of a total of 78,000 pieces of the expensive metal to form a mesh-like fabric. Despite the eye-watering price tag of 300 thousand Turkish Liras (about £84,800), eight of the unique gowns have already been sold.", "reference_summary": "Designs made from real gold were shown on the catwalk in Xi'an China .

In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) and $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for £19.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao. Once ticket sales and casino profits have been considered, the eagerly anticipated mega-fight, which is due to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will become the biggest pay-per-view in sport and could see the two fighters pocket astronomical sums. This Sports Interaction graphic shows how much Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao stand to earn . American boxing legend Mike Tyson features in four of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights . The eagerly-anticipated mega-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is just days away . Canadian data crunchers Sports Interaction have put together all the big numbers to find out who will earn what, the top 10 pay-per-view bouts by earnings and whether the event will give fans value for money. Firstly, let's take a look at how much Mayweather and Pacquiao stand to earn should the showpiece fight go the distance on May 2. 12 rounds of jousting will give Mayweather a stunning $170m (£111m) purse, meaning the 38-year-old will be picking up $15m (£9m) per round and $5m (£3m) per minute. His opponent stands to earn slightly less and could bank almost $95m (£62m) which boils down to a tidy $8.4m (£5m) per round. Pacquiao gets in his last workout in Los Angeles before heading to Las Vegas on Monday . Mayweather has featured in three of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights to date . The average payout for the top 10 pay-per-view fighters stands at $22.4m (£14m) Mayweather tends to give his viewers values for money by going the distance during his fights . Six of the top 10 pay-per-view events have gone the distance, which is encouraging news for fans across the globe who will be paying to tune in. Although the Las Vegas mega-fight is set to eclipse the highest grossing bouts to date, there will still be one man that can claim to have featured in more of the top 10 duels than Mayweather. Mike Tyson featured in four of the top 10 grossing bouts, ahead of 'Money' Mayweather and Evander Holyfield who have both featured in three. Mayweather's lucrative victory against Saul Alvarez in 2013 looks set to be eclipsed by his next bout . The American poses for photos with singer Justin Bieber after defeating Alvarez in Las Vegas . Oscar De La Hoya has featured in two, while Lennox Lewis, Miguel Cotto, Saul Alvarez, Peter McNeeley, Shane Moseley, Felix Trinidad, George Foreman and Pacquiao have all featured in one. Tyson may have featured in more of the top fights, but it's Mayweather who is currently sitting pretty at the top of the pile after his pay-per-view 12-round fight against Alvarez in September, 2013 saw the American collect a total close to $140m (£91m). Pacquiao features only once in the current list after earning around $555,555 per minute for his victory against Shane Moseley in 2011. Mike Tyson's heavyweight bout against Lennox Lewis (right) in 2002, grossed $112m (£73m) Tyson looks on after being knocked down for a final time by Lewis after just eight rounds . Tyson's biggest earner came after his defeat against British legend Lennox Lewis as the pair claimed $760,869 (£497,796) per minute each after eight rounds. Tyson is also responsible for the first and second most economically inefficient fights inside our top 10. In 1997, his constant biting of Holyfield saw him disqualified at the end of the third round, resulting in that pay-per-view event costing fans $5.59 (£3.60) a minute for the action. Those still deciding whether whether to fork out for Saturday's fight may be swayed by the fact that each fight inside the top 10 grossing bouts that has involved Mayweather or Pacquiao has gone the distance.

Jeff McCubbery, 72, from Mandurang and Ian Bullock, 65, from Blackburn devised the plan for Captain Cootie Cards over twenty years ago in a bid to counter the influx of lingo from overseas. The pair now has a quirky range of greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars – but their hopes of spreading the message were dashed after they were spurned by the companies they pitched their products to. An Illustration from best mates Ian Bullock and Jeff McCubberry, who have vowed to keep Aussie slang alive through a range a range of custom memorabilia . McCubberry told Daily Mail Australia they designed the idea after meeting on a fishing trip 25 years ago. 'We met at an annual fishing trip, and quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning.' 'People are dorks not drongos, guys not blokes. We decided to do something to keep the vocabulary afloat,' McCubbery said. 'We decided to consolidate the Australianisms we knew and loved from our upbringings-instead of the Americanisms which have ,' said Ian Bullock. With Ian Bullock (left) as illustrator and and Jeff McCubbery (right) as designer, the duo have devised a range of greeting cards, coffee mugs, stubby-holders and calendars emblazoned with down under lingo . One illustration depicts weather forecast map with the various Australian climatological zones – the Northern Territory is 'bloody muggy' , Alice Springs is 'dry as a dead dingo's donger', and Victoria is 'cold as a witch's tit'. Another card shows a fisherman sleeping next to a lake with beer can in hand and the accompanying message: 'flat out like a lizard drinking.' McCubberry believes the rise of television and the internet has let a torrent of lingo loose from Britain and America that has eclipsed the home grown counterpart. McCubberry said when the pair met on a fishing trip 20 years ago 'we quickly learned we shared the belief that the language we grew up with was waning' The best mates use lingo from their upbringing which they say has disappeared, such as the term: 'I don't give a rats a**' With McCubberry as designer and Bullock as illustrator, the mates got to work on a range of products that embody down under speech from a bygone time. But much to their dismay the pair got a rude shock when time came to pitch the product a manufacturers. 'Nobodies interested, said McCubbery. 'They say it's too crude or uncouth. It doesn't make sense because colourful language is a pivotal part of Aussie culture.' The duo plan to launch a digital campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market . Bullock said they had a deal with a major distributor that fell through before another wholesaler offered them a rather insulting rate to print the cards. 'It was pretty insulting really. It's been a real knock back but we're determined to stick at it.' The mates plan to launch a website and social media campaign in hopes of finding a distributor to get their products on the market. 'It's just a matter of getting my head around the online thing.

But when it comes to the biggest event in his life, Andy Murray is happy to take a back seat. The 2013 Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medalist has revealed he has left the vast majority of planning next week's wedding to his fiancée, Kim Sears. Scroll down for video . Murray will marry long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane Cathedral next week - he is pictured as best man at brother Jamie's wedding to Alejandra Gutierrez at the Cromlix House Hotel in 2010 . Murray was presented with a cake to mark his 500th ATP Tour victory cake in Miami this week - for his wedding he has said he was involved in the cake tasting, but has left the majority to his fiancee . Miss Sears, 27, pictured in Miami, has been been entrusted with planning the pair's wedding next week . Murray and Miss Sears, both 27, will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral next week, and the tennis star has admitted he 'couldn't care less' about the finer details of the day saying 'I try to stay out of all that sort of stuff'. However Murray, a self-confessed foodie, will have some input for the wedding as he has chosen the menu based on a series of food tasting sessions. In an American interview, the 2012 US Open winner, said: 'I think in a lot of cases it's just better to let the woman have it how she would like. 'In terms of flowers and colour schemes and those sorts of things, I couldn't really care less about that, to be honest. 'The only thing I wanted to do was to be involved with the food. Because I like my food - I like good food. 'I went along and did the food tasting, and I also did the cake tasting as well. So that would be the thing that I would say I have been most involved in.' He added: 'The music is something we chat about together as well.' Miss Sears is in charge of colours schemes and flowers as Murray admits 'he couldn't care less about that' The 27-year-old has been a permanent fixture at the court side since she and Murray started dating in 2005 . Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005 . The couple have dated since they met in 2005 . Murray and Miss Sears, who have been together for a decade, will wed at the 1000-year old Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 12th century cathedral is much larger than the chapel in the grounds of Cromlix, which seats only 28. Murray purchased the 15-bedroom country home for £1.8m in 2013. Thousands are expected to line the streets of Dunblane on the day to celebrate the wedding of their most famous son. Murray attended the primary school in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed sixteen children and one teacher in the Dunblane massacre. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. 'Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I'm sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.' The cathedral's minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, added: 'There is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.' Tom Casey, chair of Discover Dunblane, the organisation which represents the town's traders, said the couple would be 'Dunblane's royalty'. He said: 'A number of shops will be doing individual things to mark the event as they normally do when Andy is playing tennis. 'As a town, we are going to put up some bunting and wedding bows along the high street and decorate the shops with messages. 'Of course we will be making extra efforts to celebrate the wedding of Dunblane's most famous son of modern sense. He is our royalty. 'But it is also important we respect the family's wishes.' Next week's ceremony will take place at the 12th century Dunblane Cathedral (pictured) The reception will then be at Cromlix House (pictured), the five-star 15-bedroom country hotel Murray bought for £1.8million two years ago . The couple announced their engagement in November last year. Breaking with tradition, Murray will have three best men at his wedding, his brother Jamie, close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins (who recovered from cancer to return to tennis) and former training partner Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Murray said: 'The thing for me is it's double standards in a way with the guys and girls because Kim has four bridesmaids and I was saying well, \"why is that fine for you?\" 'Imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends which you've had since you were at school. it's very difficult to chose one. 'She was like, \"Come on, come on, pick one\". I said, \"No, it's difficult, so I think I'm going to have two for sure possibly a third if he can come'.\" Murray has previously played best man at Jamie's wedding when he married Alejandra Gutierrez at Cromlix House in 2010, and when Ross Hutchins tied the knot with Lindsay Wood last year. The tennis star roars in celebration after defeating Tomas Berdych in the Miami Open semi final yesterday . In previous interviews on the subject, Murray has said he is not fazed by the prospect of marriage. 'Kim and I had spoken about getting married a lot for the past couple of years but, if you go back a couple of years, we were still only 25. 'We've been together since we were 18. Because we were so young when we started - and we do spend a lot of time apart - it just felt like the right time for both of us.' Sussex-born Miss Sears, who is the daughter of former Lawn Tennis Association head of women's tennis Nigel Sears, met Murray at the US Open in 2005. She was once described by future mother-in-law Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy'. They split briefly in 2009, before rekindling their relationship. The couple live in Surrey with their two Border terriers, Maggie and Rusty. Back on the court, Murray will face world number one Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open tomorrow.

But Adams, who underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year, warned: 'I am feeling really good - my speed and timing have returned and I feel like a whole new fighter. 'I had to change my style for the Commonwealth Games because I had to hide just how much of a problem my shoulder was causing, but I came through it and took the gold medal. 'Now it is not giving me any problems at all so I can revert to the way I have always fought and hopefully the fans in Liverpool will be able to see me at my best.'", "reference_summary": "London 2012 gold medallist Nicola Adams will prolong her career .

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"", "reference_summary": "The number of new HIV infections in Indiana has grown to 142 cases .

Her food allergies change so frequently, keeping track is almost pointless. It was just another day with another massive allergic reaction. She can always tell when one is coming on. \"I just get this overwhelming sense of -- they call it impending doom.\" Her labradoodle, Moose, starts alerting, licking her hands frantically. \"I'll feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach, and then it gets hard to breathe and my throat and tongue start swelling. And we have to treat it really fast.\" On that particular day in March, multiple EpiPens didn't slow the reaction. The paramedics who arrived to take Brynn to Greenville Memorial Hospital, or \"Hotel Greenville\" as she likes to call it, knew her well. When she asked for her security blanket, they knew to hand her her smartphone. \"New day, new crisis,\" Brynn quips as she tells the story, as if it's about her first day of college or a shopping trip gone wrong. It might as well be. When you're allergic to life, a near-death experience is no big deal. Less than a week after her trip to the hospital, Brynn, 21, is back at home in Easley, South Carolina. She lies on her back, her head near the foot of her bed, chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port. Melissa Duncan, a paralegal by day, dons a mask and surgical gloves before disinfecting the area around the tube that's connected to Brynn's jugular vein. The disinfectant burns, and Brynn's blood pressure hits 150/102. Her heart rate rockets to 128. \"The meds we have to give her to keep her alive, she reacts to,\" Melissa says, shaking her head. \"Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. \" Brynn was seemingly a normal kid -- until she wasn't. Yes, she was a fussy baby. Yes, she got sick often as a child, Melissa muses out loud -- but what kid doesn't? Brynn was also incredibly energetic, always the center of attention. Her father, Barry, jokingly rues the day she learned to talk. She started taekwondo at the age of 9 and had her black belt by the time she was 11. That was the same year doctors diagnosed Brynn with IBS, or irritable bowel syndrome. \"She's always been --\" Melissa Duncan pauses. \"High maintenance!\" Brynn fills in with a laugh. It wasn't until shortly before her 16th birthday in 2010 that Brynn had her first serious allergic reaction. The next two years became a blur of sick days and doctors' appointments. Brynn saw specialist after specialist. The gastrointestinologist diagnosed her with gastroparesis, or partial paralysis of the stomach muscles. A cardiologist said she had POTS, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome -- meaning that when she stood up for longer than a few minutes, her blood pressure dropped, leaving her light-headed and nauseated. A Wake Forest doctor diagnosed her with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes fragile skin and overly flexible joints. After doing hours of research, Melissa, Barry and Brynn came up with their own diagnosis: mast cell disease. They found a specialist online, Dr. Lawrence Afrin, who at the time was working in Charleston. They waited nearly nine months to see him, but hearing him confirm their suspicions was life-changing. Scientists don't know yet what causes mast cell disease. Researchers have found mutations in mast cells that may cause the abnormal behavior, but the mutations vary from one patient to the next. Because of this, scientists suspect the mutations are acquired early in life. But genetics may make some children more susceptible to developing the mutations. Mast cells are the regulators of your immune system. They're the ones that release histamine when a bug bites, or when you come into contact with an allergen. They basically sound the alarm that lets the rest of your immune system know something is wrong. Until recently, the only mast cell disease doctors had identified was mastocytosis, which is characterized by \"abnormal proliferation and activation\" of the body's mast cells -- meaning there are way too many and they act in strange ways. But in the last few years doctors such as Afrin have started to recognize that there are many different layers to mast cell disease. For instance, Brynn has mast cell activation syndrome, meaning her mast cells act strangely, but they're not growing in number. \"It's like I'm living in a 24/7 allergic reaction,\" Brynn explains simply. Fruit, vegetables, milk, soy, nuts, smoke, perfume, the sun -- you name it, Brynn is allergic to it. But it's not really about the specifics; the allergens change depending on how \"angry\" her mast cells are that day, she says. On good days, she can eat small amounts of plain meat or mashed potatoes. On bad days, even using her feeding tube causes her extreme pain. Not everyone with mast cell activation syndrome has it as bad as Brynn does. \"Oh God, no,\" Afrin says when asked. \"No, no, no, no.\" But mast cells are located in your connective tissue, including your skin and the lining of your stomach and intestine. They can affect every system in the body, Afrin says, so the disease is capable of causing all the symptoms Brynn experiences. You have to ask yourself, he says: \"Is this poor patient so uniquely unlucky to have acquired so many different, independent problems? Or is it more likely that there is just one thing going on?\" Of course, having a diagnosis didn't make living with mast cell disease any easier. In 2012, Brynn was admitted to the hospital 30 times. She started having seizures and episodes of dystonia -- painful, violent muscle contractions that are \"scary to see and scary to experience.\" On multiple occasions, doctors have had to put casts on her legs to prevent her joints from bending in the wrong direction.", "reference_summary": "Brynn Duncan has mast cell disease, which causes her to be allergic to almost everything .

Wayne Rooney has scored 12 goals against Aston Villa, his joint-highest tally against any opponent in Premier League history along with Newcastle United.

Victim: Cherice Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial. At former teacher Stacey Rambold's sentencing, Baugh said that Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold . The judge told the Billings Gazette in August 2013 'Obviously, a 14-year-old can't consent. I think that people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape. 'It was horrible enough as it is just given her age, but it wasn't this forcible beat-up rape.' Baugh later apologized in regards to the comments concerning Moralez, telling the Gazette that month 'I don't know what I was thinking or trying to say. It was just stupid and wrong.' In an August 2013 letter to the newspaper, Baugh said 'In the Rambold sentencing, I made references to the victim's age and control. I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say, but it did not come out correct. 'What I said is demeaning of all women, not what I believe and irrelevant to the sentencing. My apologies to all my fellow citizens.' After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. Rambold is appealing the sentence.

He told The Associated Press on Thursday that he didn't know who nominated him for the achievement award. He also repeated his assertion that media reports about the rape case had not told the whole story. 'I'm not trying to say I didn't make any mistakes. If you go into all the mistakes that were made, it would give a better-balanced report,' Baugh said. Fehr said Baugh had been nominated for the award by members of the bar association, but she declined to say who that was or why he was chosen.

He was also censured by the Montana Supreme Court for his comments and suspended from the bench for 31 days . Marian Bradley, Northwest regional director for the National Organization for Women, said the award was inappropriate given Baugh's conduct on the bench. Regardless of his prior accomplishments, Bradley said the Rambold case cannot be overlooked. 'The last chapter in his career, he put himself out there and did not protect a young girl and did not protect a community,' Bradley said. 'Giving him a lifetime achievement award is going to send people into tailspins.' Despite the embarrassment Baugh brought on the Montana judiciary, at least some colleagues stuck by him. In December, state District Judge Russell Fagg wrote in a column for the Billings Gazette that Baugh handled more than 30,000 cases in his career. 'He has made thousands of good calls, and a few bad calls, as have all of us,' Fagg wrote. 'Bottom line: Baugh is a wonderful person.'

A schoolgirl was left needing medical treatment at Hounsdown School, pictured, after he water bottle was spiked with hydrochloric acid . An investigation was immediately launched into the incident that is understood to have been a classroom prank. Julie Turvey, Headteacher at Hounsdown School, said: 'The school is taking this matter very seriously and continuing its investigation. A student took a sip from a water bottle into which other students had put a small amount of hydrochloric acid. 'Immediate action was taken to assess the student and the risk of serious harm. First aid treatment was administered and, thankfully, no significant injury was caused and no subsequent medical or hospital treatment was needed. 'The welfare and safety of all pupils attending this school is our priority. We have reported the incident to the Police and two students have been temporarily excluded.' The schoolgirl, who is in Year 11, raised the alarm on Tuesday after taking a sip from her drink. She discovered an unusual taste and smell to the liquid. The child's science teacher abandoned the lesson while the girl was sent to the school medical room, assessed and given water to drink. Tests reportedly showed the girl's water bottle had been contaminated with hydrochloric acid, pictured left. Julie Turvey, Headteacher at Hounsdown School, pictured right said they were taking the matter 'very seriously' A group of boys thought to have been 'messing around' in the lesson were later questioned about the incident. Tests reportedly showed the bottle was contaminated with the substance but that the concentration of the acid was low. The schoolgirl, who has not been named, did not require hospital treatment or suffered any ill effects as a result. Hydrochloric acid is a highly corrosive solution of hydrogen chloride and water; and it is clear and colourless, but highly pungent. It is widely used, including for manufacturing plastic, removing rust from steel, producing leathers, neutralising swimming pools and treating drinking and waste water. If it contacts the skin it can cause severe burns, ulceration and scarring. Hounsdown School is a specialist science college and one of 110 schools in England with teaching school status which allows them to train the teachers of the future. In July 2011 it converted to a 'new style' academy, run by a governing body free from local authority control. It was rated 'good' in its last Ofsted report in 2012 and last year 70 per cent of its 237 year 11 students achieved grade A* to C in English and maths.

Sebastiano Quagliata and his wife, Valbona Lucaj, pleaded no contest to owning a dangerous dog causing death in the fatal mauling last summer of Craig Sytsma of Livonia, The Flint Journal reported. 'I'm so sorry,' Lucaj told Sytsma's family. Sytsma, 46, was attacked by two cane corsos last July in Metamora Township, 45 miles northwest of Detroit. Sebastiano Quagliata (pictured) and his wife, Valbona Lucaj, pleaded no contest to owning a dangerous dog causing death in the fatal mauling of Craig Sytsma of Livonia, Michigan, and agreed to 15 years in jail . Lucaj (left), a native of Albania, and Quagliata, of Italy, could be deported after serving their sentences . Sytsma, 46, was attacked by two cane corsos last July in Metamora Township, 45 miles northwest of Detroit . The father-of-three was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in Metamora Township in July, and was 'screaming and begging' for help in his final minutes. Lapeer County Prosecutor Tim Turkelson predicts a sentence of at least 19 months in prison when the two return to court on June 8. The two have been in custody for months and were facing a second-degree murder charge before making the plea deal. Lucaj, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, a native of Italy, could be deported after serving their sentences. They had 'no intention to do anything to hurt anyone,' defense attorney Jason Malkiewicz said. 'I think today was the first day my clients got to sit over there and accept responsibly for actions,' he said. 'I think the death of Mr Sytsma has sat in their heads for a year and it's been a nightmare to my clients, as well as everyone involved.' Attorney Glenn Saltsman said the Sytsma family is satisfied with the plea deal, although he believes laws covering dangerous dogs are 'archaic and weak'. There was evidence that the dogs had attacked other people on the road. 'These dogs should've never been alive after the first attack,' Saltsman said. The father-of-three was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in July . Attorney Glenn Saltsman said the Sytsma family is satisfied with the plea deal. The sentencing will be in June . During the attack, one neighbor, a medic, used a belt as a tourniquet to stop Sytsma's bleeding. Helen Barwig had to pause the rescue efforts momentarily while the massive dogs came back. 'I'm bleeding out,' a desperate Sytsma told his rescuer, according to the Detroit Free Press. 'I'm dying.' He 'was losing a lot of blood and begged her to not let him die,' police wrote about incident. It took another neighbor, Barwig's boyfriend Edward Elmer, firing his .44-caliber Magnum at the dogs to end the attack. He struck one of the animals in the leg. Sytsma only had time to tell Barwig that his name was Craig before losing consciousness. He was rushed to a local hospital but soon died of his injuries. His dramatic final moments were revealed in response to a request by the Free Press under Michigan's Freedom of Information Act. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said . The police records show the two dogs had run loose for months in the small rural community, attacking at least two neighbors months before they killed Sytsma. Some neighbors began to arm themselves, including the man whose shots eventually scared the cane corsos as Sytsma laid dying. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said. 'Animal control should have done something,' said April Smith, who was bitten in May 2012 while walking her two dogs. Cane corsos are Italian dogs that are 'not to be trifled with', according to the American Kennel Club. The AKC report about the breed said: 'Topping out at nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscular frame, Cane Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures.' 'Bred as guard dogs for centuries, their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders.'", "reference_summary": "Father-of-three Craig Sytsma was mauled to death in Michigan last year .

The Home Office was warned that Lord Janner was abusing young boys two decades ago but did nothing about it. An MP passed a dossier of information to the department in the hope it would kick-start a fresh police investigation. But instead the paperwork was shelved by officials until it was discovered in 2013 and belatedly passed to Leicestershire Police. The revelation will heighten fears that the peer, now 86, was the beneficiary of an Establishment cover-up. The missed opportunity to bring him to justice echoes the case of the late paedophile Liberal MP Cyril Smith who continued in public life despite repeated warnings of his crimes. It heaps pressure on the Home Office to reveal exactly who knew what and when about the disturbing allegations against Janner. Last night Labour’s Simon Danczuk – who outed Smith as a predatory child abuser – called on the department to ‘come clean’. ‘The Director of Public Prosecutions has admitted there were previously missed opportunities to investigate Lord Janner,’ he said. ‘The Home Office needs to come clean on what information was passed to officials in 1995. ‘This scandal is getting worse every day and the public are rightly angry at the shambolic way this case has been handled.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders sparked fury earlier this month when she said Janner could face 22 charges but his health is too poor to put him on trial. She said that the former Leicester MP was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2006 but mistakes meant he was never charged. Now the Daily Mail can reveal a fourth opportunity was missed when an unnamed MP passed a dossier to the Home Office in 1995. The politician received a letter linking Janner to prolific paedophile Frank Beck, who died in jail the previous year. Beck was jailed in 1991 for abusing children after a trial in which Janner was named by a victim, prompting him to proclaim his innocence in the Commons. The MP expected the 11 pages of detailed notes, which also identified several other suspects, to be passed to police. But nothing was done until it was uncovered during a review of Home Office archives in 2013. Labour MP Simon Danczuk is calling for the Home Office to 'come clean' over the dossier. The Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders earlier sparked fury by saying Lord Janner could face 22 charges . Lord Janner’s £2million home was transferred to his three children by someone holding power of attorney, officials have confirmed. The apartment near Hampstead Heath in North London was signed over free of charge in March last year – the same month police raided his Westminster office and three months after they searched his home. The apartment is likely to have been Janner’s most valuable asset, and the revelation raises questions about whether the Labour grandee – who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2009 – and his family planned for the possibility of being sued by his alleged victims. In 2013, paedophile BBC presenter Stuart Hall signed over the deeds of his £2million mansion to his wife just before he was jailed. He then offered his victims as little as £2,000 compensation. Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the review over fears her department was holding evidence of historic child abuse by influential people. A trawl through more than 700,000 documents identified four ‘items’ that should be passed to police. In a heavily censored report, one document involved the paedophile ring led by Beck which preyed on vulnerable children at Leicestershire care homes. It stated: ‘Allegations from XX that XX could have been involved in the child abuse along with convicted paedophile Frank Beck. The writer… also claimed that some police investigations had already taken place but there is no evidence that the Home Office passed the complete information to police.’ Michael Howard was Home Secretary when the MP sent the letter warning about Janner to his department. A spokesman for the former Tory leader, who is now a peer, said he had ‘no recollection’ of seeing the dossier but believes such material should have been forwarded to police. Soon after the publication of the Theresa May review, a second, more in-depth report homed in on allegations against Janner in August 2014. Conducted by NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless, it specifically asked Government departments to search their archives for mentions of ‘Greville Janner’. When the report was published in November it revealed a file on Janner was among 114 dossiers on child sex abuse that went missing from the Home Office. Last night, the Home Office highlighted how both reviews did not directly accuse it of covering up information on child abuse.", "reference_summary": "MP handed dossier of information to the department to kick-start a probe .

A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defence team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on Wednesday. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . Boston Police patrol the outside the John J Moakley Federal Courthouse after the jury verdict . The jury will now decide whether the 21-year-old former student should be sentenced to death or receive life in prison. Tsarnaev's conviction was widely expected, given his lawyer's startling admission during opening statements that he took part in the bombing. But the lawyer also argued that Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, masterminded the attack and enlisted his then-19-year-old brother to help. On April 19, 2013, Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat and had written notes inside suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries . Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as full partners in a plan to retaliate against the US for its wars in Muslim countries. The court will likely meet early next week to resume the penalty phase. Families of the victims were also present to hear the verdict but there was no celebration after each 'guilty' was read and jury members were similarly somber. COUNT 1: GUILTY .

He's visited places such as Haiti, Venezuela and Colombia. The greater adjutant stork initially drew Bouldry to Boragaon, but he became connected with the people. About 100 families live inside the Boragaon landfill. Every day, they search the area for treasure -- a tiny scrap of metal, a bit of plastic, maybe a bone. They use large hooks to sort through the garbage, which sometimes reaches two or three stories high. They work in teams, and more than often they are barefoot. \"They don't look at the things they're doing as being unsanitary or unhealthy or unsafe,\" Bouldry said. They collect plastic, metal and wires and sell it by the pound. The families make around $2 per day. Their homes are constructed by recycled materials, with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time. With no electricity, no running water -- and an overabundance of trash -- they are experts at repurposing. \"You might see a refrigerator being used as a closet,\" he said. Social media .

Some of the children living in Boragaon go to school on scholarship, but most of them work in the landfill to provide for their families. But don't be deceived: The people living here feel anything but destitute. Bouldry uses words such as \"love,\" \"hope\" and \"spirituality\" to describe them. \"I found that the landfill community is content,\" Bouldry said. \"They are not jaded by modern civilization.\" Bouldry lives and works inside the La Chureca landfill in Nicaragua, one of the largest landfills in the world. He helps the people living there grow gardens fertilized with compost he makes with organic waste from local smoothie shops. In addition to his photography, he teaches English and yoga classes a few times per week. But why? Bouldry went to art school in Boston. He's no stranger to sophisticated civilization. He said he found humanitarian photo projects to be the most fulfilling, and he became especially intrigued by landfills even though they are \"scary, dirty and kind of grotesque.\" \"This is my 'thank you' to the informal recyclers of the world,\" he said.

'Did he make all the right decisions? No,' defense attorney James Sultan said. 'He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew. He really didn't know what to do. So he just put one foot in front of the other.' After closing arguments from the defense and the prosecution, the jury began their deliberations on Tuesday afternoon. If convicted, Hernandez faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. The former New England Patriots football player, 25, has pleaded not guilty to murder and firearms charges in the death of Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who was dating his fiancée's sister.

His defense argued that he witnessed the killing of a friend but did not commit it himself . Defiant: Defense attorney James Sultan holds a photo of the murder scene during closing arguments . Prosecutor William McCauley points to Hernandez on Tuesday as he told jurors to simply look at the evidence . Prosecutors say the former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home before dawn on June 17, 2013, and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's house in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they shot him to death. Surveillance video at Hernandez's home minutes after the shooting showed him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun. A joint found near Lloyd's body had Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it. Murdered: Semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, was shot dead near Hernandez's home in June 2013 . Cellphone records shared in court also showed the men communicating with Lloyd that night. Surveillance video along the way showed Hernandez driving the Nissan shortly before Lloyd's sister saw him get into a silver car, a moment captured on a neighbor's security camera. Soon after, a toll booth camera caught the Nissan leaving Boston, while Lloyd's phone pinged several cell towers before stopping in North Attleborough for good. His body was found in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home later that day. Lloyd had been shot six times. In his closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney William McCauley told jurors to go through all the evidence. 'If you do that, you'll get to where you need to go, which is to find the defendant guilty for the murder of Odin Lloyd,' McCauley said. But the defense said the prosecution's case failed to prove Hernandez pulled the trigger. Prosecutors have never presented a motive to jurors and Sultan added on Monday that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends who shared 'a passion for marijuana'. 'Obviously they were friends,' Sultan told the jury. 'They were future brothers-in-law.' Wallace and Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately. Both men used the drug PCP, according to attorneys and court documents, and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent, unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair. Blame game: Attorneys from the defense team said Carlos Ortiz, left, and Ernest Wallace, right, were responsible for the murder - not Hernandez.

Emotional: An uncle of Odin Lloyd is comforted as he hears details about his nephew's death on Tuesday . Investigators say Lloyd was shot multiple times with a Glock .45-caliber handgun that has not been found. Sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony, prosecutors 'still haven't proved to you who killed Odin Lloyd.' During the trial, which started in late January, the prosecution called 131 witnesses while the defense called three. Sultan also attacked the investigation, saying a shell casing removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez had been contaminated with his client's DNA from a piece of chewing gum stuck to it. 'The investigation done in this case was incomplete, biased and inept. That was not fair to Odin Lloyd, that was not fair to Aaron Hernandez, and it was not fair to you,' he said. 'All that effort and this is all they could come up with. What does that tell you?' Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury. Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was cut after being charged with Lloyd's killing in June 2013.

Edward Moore was working in his first job as assistant director of music at King Edward's School in Witley, Surrey, when he had consensual sex with the 16-year-old student in his office. After the incident, the 24-year-old said to her: 'Oh my God, you have to forgive me, you will hate me one day.' Moore, from Ascot, Berkshire, was jailed for nine months on Friday after admitting two counts of abusing a position of trust and sexual activity with a girl aged 13 to 17 years. A choirmaster at King Edward's School (above) in Witley, Surrey, took a vulnerable student's virginity just months after she confided in him that she had been abused by another music teacher, a court heard . He had only been working for a few months when he began to grow close to the student. The girl came to him in November 2012 to reveal she had been touched inappropriately by another music teacher when she was aged just 13. Moore, who was the girl’s choirmaster, had only been at the school for a few months. Gary Ponds, prosecuting at Guildford Crown Court, told how Moore had taken on a counselling role for the traumatised young girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. He said: 'Their relationship over time developed until it was past the point of a proper teaching relationship.' While Moore did not teach the girl he was in position of authority as her choirmaster. After rumours began circulating at the £29,000-a-year school, which Sally Bercow previously attended, the headmaster warned Moore not to spend any more time alone with the pupil or let her into his office. But their friendship blossomed into a sexual relationship over the summer of 2013. They sometimes spent Friday nights together and secretly travelled to Westminster Abbey and the Isle of Wight on trips. Mr Ponds said that on one Friday Moore asked if the student wanted have sexual intercourse. Gary Ponds, prosecuting at Guildford Crown Court (above), told how Edward Moore, 24, had taken on a counselling role for the traumatised young girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons . He continued: 'She agrees and that is what happened. She made it clear that she was a virgin at the time. 'It was abundantly clear throughout that this was an emotionally fragile girl.' There was no further sexual activity and Moore, who did not use a condom, cut communication with the pupil. She later rang Childline because she was feeling suicidal and confessed about the tryst to a school chaplain, who was obliged to tell the school. Judge Peter Moss said the impact of Moore's offending had forced the schoolgirl to move to another school and left her with 'long term implications on her education and her future dreams'. He described her as a 'bright and ambitious girl'. He added: 'Her emotions have been in a high degree of mess because of your actions. 'You knew of her vulnerabilities, that is how you came to be in the proximity. Taking her on trips amounts to a grooming of her. 'It appears by this stage she was starry-eyed and in love with you and you expressed the same to her. The £29,000-a-year school was previously attended by Sally Bercow, pictured (above) in 2014 . 'The following week you took her virginity without a condom. These are all aggravating features. 'You stole her innocence.' Moore, dressed in a white shirt and blue tie, wiped his eyes as details of his victim's trauma were read to the court. Rina-Marie Hill, defending, said Moore had struggled to cope with the pressure of hearing the details of the student's previous abuse in his first term of work, having no experience of teaching or any training. She said: 'He wasn't allocated the complainant to look after, she came to him and for a significant time their relationship was a proper student-teacher relationship. 'The activity ceased because of Mr Moore's actions - he realised he had gone too far and he distanced himself from the complainant.' The choirmaster described the two instances of sexual activity over two weeks as a 'horrific mistake' that he would 'pay for for the rest of his life,' the court heard. Ms Hill added: 'He will never teach again and he will have this conviction on his record for the rest of his life.' Judge Moss told the court he found it 'impossible' to avoid imposing an immediate custodial sentence, despite Moore's early admission of guilt and previous 'exemplary' character. Sentencing he said: 'It is abundantly clear that you have much to offer and that this is out of character. 'But the message must be understood by those in positions of trust, however young. 'You were 23, an intelligent man who knew what you were dealing with. You knew that she had immature, young and fragile emotions and there can be no mercy for someone who abuses that.' Moore will also be put on the Sex Offenders Register and will be barred from working with children.

Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz searched the internet for information on suicide and depression using the name 'Skydevil', it has emerged. The chilling username was discovered after analysis of a tablet computer found at his home, according to German newspaper Bild. Investigators also found search terms for disorders such as 'bipolar' and 'manic depressive'. In a separate development, it has emerged that European regulators warned Germany's aviation authority of inadequacies with its health check-ups in a regular review of air safety enforcement, the European Commission said. Its statement did not say when the review was carried out. But the Wall Street Journal said the Commission told Berlin in November 'to remedy the long-standing problems' - months before the Germanwings crash that killed all 150 people aboard. Meanwhile, the aviation authority, the Luftfahrtbundesamt (LBA), also said it did not know about Lubitz's medical background prior to the crash. Parent company Lufthansa said Lubitz told officials at an airline training school he had gone through a period of severe depression in the past, raising questions over whether medical checks of crew members by the safety regulators and airlines are rigorous enough. EU officials found that the LBA had a lack of staff, which could have limited its ability to carry out checks on planes and crew, such as medical checks, the Journal reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. It said it was unclear whether the deficiencies identified at LBA were factors in the crash, however. Vetting of airline crew is in the spotlight after the budget airline flight was crashed deliberately into by Lubitz. 'On the basis of EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) recommendations, the Commission has addressed the issues to Germany to require compliance. 'Germany's replies are currently being assessed,' the Commission spokesman said in the statement, emailed out on Saturday. 'All EU member states have findings and this is a normal and regular occurrence. It is part of a continuous system of oversight: findings are followed by corrective action, similar to an audit process,' the Commission spokesman said, without specifying EASA's findings in Germany. The spokesman was not immediately available for further comment. The Germanwings Airbus A320 (above) crashed into a mountain at 430mph, killing all 150 people on board . A spokeswoman for the LBA said EASA's audits of national aviation authorities such as the LBA took place several times a year. She said the LBA had answered a single-figure number of criticisms levelled at it during the audits and those responses were now being assessed by EASA. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that Lufthansa did not inform aviation regulators that Lubitz had struggled with depression. Sources at the Federal Aviation Office (LBA) said they were never made aware of the 27-year-old's mental health issues and only learned about them following the disaster. Lubitz perished in the crash alongside all those on board after locking his co-pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately accelerating into the French mountainside, prosecutors claim. His lengthy battle with depression was revealed afterwards when investigators carried out extensive checks on his record. However the LBA says it was never told of the observations made by doctors who had examined the 27-year-old in his 'earlier phase of serious depression'. The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week and revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now also been retrieved from the wreckage . German newspaper Welt am Sonntag quoted sources as having discovered his mental health issues three days after the crash by accessing his medical file at Lufthansa's Aeromedical Center. Records revealed he had been tested by doctors six times, the report claimed. Lufthansa declined to comment on its claims citing the ongoing investigation into the crash. Earlier the airline's chief Carsten Spohr said it was entirely unaware Lubitz had suffered any health issues that would have compromised his ability to fly. Last week it however conceded he had told his flight school of a previous bout of 'severe depression' in 2009. He was later given a medical certificate confirming he was fit to fly. Prosecutors claimed the pilot was diagnosed as suicidal several years before receiving his licence and that doctors had only recently concluded there was no evidence he wanted to harm himself. French emergency rescue services work at the crash site of the Germanwings plane where 150 people died . Lubitz had been signed off sick repeatedly in the days before the crash, with doctors notes found crumpled in his apartment following the disaster. Forensics teams are still working at the crash site, painstakingly recovering debris which they hope will aid investigations. It is not yet known whether the pilot was taking medication at the time of the crash, though data recovered from the scene revealed he had deliberately accelerated into the side of a mountain. He had previously been prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong that users are warned not to drive while under its influence. In the days before hand he had researched suicide methods and cockpit security online, all the while telling doctors he was not flying but on sick leave.

And Melissa would have got away with it - had it not been for eagle eyed fans who spotted unmistakeable murals at the state capital Morelia building. Furious officials say the star didn't have permission to film at the courthouse. Supreme Court President Juan Antonio Magaña blasted: ‘It’s not possible to hire out these buildings for any price. At least not legally.' Speculating how the pop star got in, state governor Fausto Vallejo said he suspected the guards may have received bribes. Melissa's father, Enrique Plancarte, headed one of Mexico's biggest drugs cartels which was infamous for hanging its victims by the neck from motorway bridges. Plancarte made millions before he died in a shoot out with the Mexican Navy last year. He owned Melissa's record label, PlanRecords - which has just two other acts on its books - Melissa's brother and sister Kike and Jazet. The stunning singer, who owns three pet tigers and boasts about her lavish lifestyle on Instagram, only recently admitted who her father was. She was outed in a social media campaign by Michoacan self-defence groups, who are waging a war to rid the state of drugs families. Mobster Plancarte was responsible for numerous deaths across Mexico. He headed the Knights Templar cartel, which smuggled crystal meth into the US. The mob boss was killed after a bounty of £435,000 was placed on his head by the government. His shooting sent shockwaves through the Knights Templar. ‘We knew this was going to happen but nothing can prepare you for it,' Melissa revealed after attending her father’s funeral.

And last April, the Cartel Princess posted photos on social media from inside a property that had been seized by the Knights Templar through an illegal extortion racket. To hit back, she published a music video called ‘Me Vale’ ('I Don’t Care’) filmed in the house with her crime family.

In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the Coalition had spent five years ‘trying to lift people up’ by making work pay and encouraging responsibility. ‘Just because some people have disagreed with our policies, does not mean those policies are missing in moral content,’ he insisted. Scroll down for video . Trip with George: Prime Minister David Cameron visited Marston's Brewery in Wolverhampton yesterday . Statement: In an Easter message to Christians, the Prime Minister insisted the coalition had spent five years 'trying to lift people up' by making work pay and encouraging responsibility . His intervention came as another senior Tory, chief whip Michael Gove, claimed Christians in Britain were being dismissed with a combination of condescension and suspicion. Six weeks ago, the Church provoked a row with ministers by publishing an unprecedented guide to how the country’s 30million Christians should ‘approach the General Election’. Bishops insisted it was not targeted at any particular party, and criticised successive governments while calling for a ‘fresh moral vision’. But much of the 50-page document was widely interpreted as indirect criticism of the Coalition’s welfare policies, which include a £26,000-a-year cap on household benefits, a new universal credit designed to ensure people are always better off in work and tough sanctions to prevent people languishing on jobless benefits. The bishops complained that welfare claimants were ‘described in terms that imply they are undeserving, dependent and ought to be self-sufficient’. They insisted it was ‘game-playing … to claim that anyone who cares about the impact of austerity on the most vulnerable members of society is… careless about the extent of national indebtedness’. The Archbishop of Canterbury the Most Rev Justin Welby - pictured ahead of a service for the re-burial of Richard III at Leicester Cathedral last week - has seen the Church of England come under fire from the PM . Despite evidence that the best-off are paying more in tax than ever before, the bishops also complained that ‘the greatest burdens of austerity have not been borne by those with the broadest shoulders’. Official Treasury figures suggest that the richest 10 per cent of households are contributing most to deficit reduction. Archbishop of York John Sentamu blamed welfare cuts and 'poverty wages' for rising inequality . Speaking to Premier Christianity magazine, Mr Cameron said the ‘values of the Christian faith are the values on which our nation was built’. ‘I’m an unapologetic supporter of the role of faith in this country. And for me, the key point is this: the values of Easter and the Christian religion – compassion, forgiveness, kindness, hard work and responsibility – are values that we can all celebrate and share,’ he added. Mr Cameron conceded he was not a model Christian and was ‘a bit hazy on the finer points of our faith’. ‘But even so, in the toughest of times, my faith has helped me move on and drive forward. It also gives me a gentle reminder every once in a while about what really matters and how to be a better person, father and citizen,’ he added. The Prime Minister said he had attempted to ‘banish the notion that being in government means you can somehow wave a magic wand and solve all the world’s problems’, and instead it was about ‘the right judgement… based on clear values and beliefs’. He said the Government had inherited ‘exceptional pressure on the national finances’ from Labour, adding: ‘I am proud that despite the pressure on public spending, we made clear choices to help the poorest paid and most vulnerable in society. ‘We have increased NHS spending, despite the overriding need to deal with the deficit. We also raised the threshold of income tax to lift the poorest paid out of income tax altogether. ‘More fundamentally, the core of our recovery programme – dealing with the deficit to restore confidence in our economy – is based on enduring ideas and principles: hard work, fair play, rewarding people for doing the right thing, and securing a better future for our children.’ Writing in The Spectator magazine today, Mr Gove said that the popular image of Christianity was at odds with the reality of churches across the country, which daily offered ‘thousands of quiet kindnesses’ to those most in need. ‘To call yourself a Christian in contemporary Britain is to invite pity, condescension or cool dismissal.’ Nick Clegg is on course to lose his seat to Labour, a poll suggested yesterday. A survey of voters in the Lib Dem leader’s Sheffield Hallam constituency put Labour on 36 per cent of the vote compared with 34 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Prime Minister's wife: Samantha Cameron arrives for a visit to Abbey Court School in Rainham, Kent . Samantha Cameron yesterday visited a primary school in the seat of Rochester and Strood, held by former Tory Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip and won a by-election last year. Despite his victory, the Conservatives are hopeful of recapturing the seat at the General Election. Reckless’s party Ukip, meanwhile, has said 16 and 17-year-olds should not be allowed to vote in a referendum on membership of the European Union. Its deputy chairman claims children are being exposed to ‘propaganda’ from Brussels in a bid to ‘catch them young’. Suzanne Evans said: ‘It’s everything there from colouring-in books on the Common Agricultural Policy for primary schoolchildren right up to research projects at university level. ‘The amount of money that the EU is putting into this propaganda and throughout the entire education system is enormous. 'Overall the EU has an advertising budget that is larger than Coca-Cola.’ It is thought the Lib Dems would demand 16 and 17-year-olds are given a say in any EU referendum as part of a post-election coalition deal.", "reference_summary": "Prime Minister said Coalition had spent 5 years 'trying to lift people up' In an Easter message to Christians he defended 'moral content' of cuts .

However, after reaching 18st, he decided to embark on a strict diet and after shedding the pounds and slimming down to 12st, he landed a job at Abercrombie & Fitch, where he was scouted by top agency, Models 1. His best friend Jamie Jewitt, 24, from Essex, weighed 15st before his 15th birthday. Jamie was so self-conscious with his looks, he barely posed for any photographs and has hardly any snaps from his teen years.

After two years of intense and solid training - which included following a strict vegan diet for a year - he shed the excess weight and now weighs 12st. After he shed the weight, his family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked. The first casting was unsuccessful and he focused on his education. But fearing that he'd feel defeated, his parents encouraged him to go to a second casting. He was successful and moved out to New York alone to pursue his career in modelling.

And now, they say they want to use their new-found platform to speak out in a bid to break the ’shame’ around ‘body image’ and ‘insecurity’ amongst men. So why do some men struggle to talk about body insecurities? Jamie and Henry think it is a 'masculine thing'. Discussing the topic, Jamie said: 'This year we have seen women leading the way. The likes of the Spice Girls encouraged the \"feel good\" movement. They encouraged women coming together and celebrating \"body beautiful\". 'But, for men, we are all too cowardly to talk about body image and insecurities. Even though we are all feeling it, we are not having those discussions down the gym. You don’t want to be that guy that gets a tough time from your mates for talking out. It is silly really.' After he shed the weight, Jamie's family urged him to go to a casting following years of taunts about the way he looked - and he managed to get spotted and now stars in the biggest designer's campaigns . The pair want to use their newfound platform for the better and are getting set to promote healthy male body image in a photoshoot with Attitude/Ateen coming out in June . Henry added: 'For some reason men don’t feel like they can admit that they are insecure about their looks, that they don’t feel the same pressures that women do. But with all the women paving the way for us and speaking out so confidently about their insecurities, we thought, why not admit to the world that we’re not always comfortable in our skin either. 'Where are the male celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? There aren’t any. Where are the female celebrity ambassadors talking out about body image? Everywhere. 'From Pink to Kelly Clarkson. Women are out there talking loud and proud. We are letting the side down.'

Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video . In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permission . In an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times. In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption. Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, \"paws\" aloft. 'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.' Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studio . Terry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West . When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, \"That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.' But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.' However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. In fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'. Known to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse. Further sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. Terry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party . Indeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour. In 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!' Then in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.' In 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. She said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. 'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Terry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up pose . Terry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010 . Furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. One model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. Jamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. \"I love tampons!\" he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.' She refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product. Jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. Terry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, \"Do you want to do nudes?\" And they're like, \"I don't want to be naked\". 'So I say, \"I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus\".' Despite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt . Last year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. 'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. 'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.' She also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers. Richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six. Charlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.' Terry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012 . In the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' He said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' He said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. 'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.' The model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' Terry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan . Terry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. These include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. The model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' However Richardson remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. And he still works with the likes of Harper's Bazaar and brands such as Supreme and Yves Saint Laurent. Designer Marc Jacobs once defended Terry as being, 'not ill-spirited.' Terry's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician. He got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for Vibe magazine. Since then he has enjoyed a stint living in London working for publications such as The Face and Arena but now shoots mainly from his studio in New York. The photographer has also directly music videos in his time. One of the most controversial was for Lady Gaga. Terry shot the video for Do What U Want a collaboration between Gaga and R Kelly last year, however, the project was later scrapped. TMZ later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the New York Post was, 'literally an ad for rape.' The clip shows Gaga lying on a hospital bed, she is put under anesthetic by R Kelly who then fondles her body along with a series of models.

Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.'

'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under…a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.'

He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Police said the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after they intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on suspicion that he was instigating a beheading, again on Australian soil. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the 14-year-old's arrest was linked to counter terrorism operations in Australia.

From there, she hoped to cross the Mediterranean Sea so her baby could be born in Europe. She didn't get there. She was arrested as she was sailing north and is now one of 350 migrants being held in a facility just outside Tripoli. Other pregnant women fleeing repression have come to Libya -- many fleeing fighting that refuses to stop. They, like male migrants, are willing to risk their lives on crowded boats to make the final part of the trip. The Somali woman's baby, Sabrine, was born a week after she was detained. Libyan officials are in a quandary. The prison head admitted to CNN there is no system in place to send these people home, jail them or let them go. About one-third of the migrants are from Eritrea on the east coast of Africa. They denied they were heading to Europe and told CNN they just want to go home, which is several thousands of miles away. In one sense, they are fortunate, even though the time in prison seems like forever. They are alive. Many others have died when smugglers' ships sink. Bodies wash up on Libyan beaches. They are anonymous -- no IDs, no links to who they were and what was in their past that drove them to try the dangerous trip. In Malta, there are similar stories of death. On Thursday, the bare, stark caskets came in one by one on the shoulders of Maltese soldiers. The tears soon came along with them. That was the scene in a tent outside the Mater Dei Hospital in Valletta, Malta, a chance for citizens and dignitaries to remember 24 of what's thought to be hundreds of migrants killed when their crammed ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Almost all the other victims haven't been accounted for yet, with the presumption that their bodies remain trapped inside the 66-foot (20-meter) boat that capsized late Saturday roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Libya. Italian authorities have said that many of the estimated 850 aboard had been locked in the ship's lower levels with no way out. Why I fled: Migrants share their stories . The tragedy has prompted questions about the growing migrant crisis facing Europe, as well as about who is responsible for Saturday's tragedy. The Catania, Italy, prosecutor's office announced Tuesday that the vessel's 27-year-old captain, Mohammed Ali Malek, and crew member Mahmud Bikhit have been arrested on suspicion of \"reckless shipwreck, multiple manslaughter (and) abetting clandestine immigration\" for their roles in the disaster. Those questions still need to be answered. But Thursday, at least, was a day for reflection -- about lives snuffed out simply because people wanted a better life. \"This event reminds us that we are all immigrants and our life is a journey of migration,\" Imam Mohammed El Sadi said at Thursday's funeral. \"Our grandparents Adam and Eve, peace be onto them, emigrated from heaven to earth. We emigrated from our mothers' wombs to this world, and we will immigrate to the graves.\" The deaths are the latest illustration of the increasing flow of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East through the Mediterranean and into Europe -- assuming they survive the trip. Gemma Parkin, a spokeswoman for Save the Children, said that the number of migrants who have fled to find refuge in Europe has skyrocketed 70% this year over last, a dramatic rise that she attributed mostly to the deteriorating security situation in Libya. About 8% of the recorded migrants between January and April 19 of this year are children, Parkin said. Of those, 70% aren't unaccompanied by adults -- some of them as young as 9 years old. Such numbers represent only people rescued at sea or caught once they reach land. Frontex, the European Union's border management agency, says that many illegal immigrants get through without being detected; moreover, most of them come in legally via airports and then overstay their visas.

'I take it in mind,' van Gaal says, before folding the sheet of paper and putting it in his pocket. 'You are smart, and a very cheap manager.' Tanveer told the Dutchman not to follow up the loan signing of Radamel Falcao with a permanent deal, and also suggested that striker Robin van Persie should be sold. The supporter's mentor said he had spent a week writing up his shortlist ahead of the foundation day, and after being warmly received by the manager, the beaming recipient of a signed home shirt said, 'It was really nice of him to do that.

The low-key video she released on Sunday announcing her run for the White House is filled with women -- young, old, black, white, Asian and Latina -- working in their gardens, taking care of their kids and getting ready for life in the working world. Clinton, who made herself the center of her campaign announcement in 2007, is barely in the video at all, appearing at the end as a kind of everywoman whose story and fight could be folded in with all the others. \"I'm getting ready to do something, too. I'm running for president,\" Clinton said in the video. \"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead.\" Clinton often says there's no better time in history to be born female than the present. She's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation's first woman president. The challenge for Clinton in breaking the \"highest, hardest glass ceiling\" that she described in 2008 is laying out a precise campaign vision that connects with all voters, while generating excitement and anticipation over the possibility of making history. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist. \"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University. \"People are ready for a woman president. The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\" According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries again . In the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough. She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on. The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. \"She is the gender card. She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. \"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\" Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years. The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\" Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton. \"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\" In 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\" \"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign. You aren't going to win 100% of women.\" Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men. Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said. And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell. But Clinton will have some high-profile champions. Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. \"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\" In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes. But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.", "reference_summary": "Hillary Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics .

That beat the old record of 581 kilometers per hour (361 miles per hour), which was set in 2003 during another Japanese maglev test. Right now, China operates the world's fastest commercial maglev, which has hit 431 kilometers per hour (268 miles per hour) on a route through Shanghai. By contrast, the fastest train in the United States, Amtrak's Acela Express, is only capable of 241 kilometers per hour (150 miles per hour), though it usually plods along at half that speed. Unlike traditional trains, maglev trains work by using magnets to push the train away from the tracks and drive the train forward. Japan's maglevs don't use metal tracks — instead, they float nearly 10 cm (4 inches) above special guideways, allowing for frictionless movement. Japan Railways has been testing their train to figure out the best operational speed for a planned route between Tokyo and Nagoya, scheduled to begin service in 2027. That trip can take nearly 5 hours by car. But in the future, a maglev train could finish the journey in 40 minutes. READ MORE: The future of transportation will blow your hair back .

Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them and Bayern are set to continue their domestic domination this term. This time, however, the two giant antagonists of the German game meet with 31 points and nine positions separating them in the standings, but that does not mean the stakes are not as high as they always are when these two clubs meet. Jurgen Klopp (centre) celebrates with his Borussia Dortmund players after their victory against Hannover . Dortmund are now only five points from the top six having climbed their way from the foot of the table at the midway stage of the season to 10th, although their coach Jurgen Klopp insists their league position after the Klassiker is not his biggest concern. 'We've got to try to beat Bayern and where that can take us in the league is secondary,' Klopp said. 'Although we're 10th, and although there's a huge points gap between us, and although a lot is different compared to the past, it's still a Borussia Dortmund home game. 'I don't recall us gifting any of these games in the past. Dortmund's Jakub Blaszczykowski (right) challenges Hannover centre back Christian Schulz . 'Gladbach have shown us how it's done. Wolfsburg have also beaten them, but it's not all that easy.' Victory would nevertheless be important for Dortmund if they are to close the gap on the top six and qualify for Europe next season, while a second consecutive defeat for Bayern is almost unheard of and it would allow Wolfsburg to reduce the deficit at the top to seven points. The Wolves host bottom-placed Stuttgart on Saturday while third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach can strengthen their grip on a place in the Champions League with a win at Hoffenheim. The battle at the bottom of the table is intensifying with all of the bottom eight sides separated by just seven points and still in danger. Xabi Alonso cuts a cool figure during Bayern Munich's training session on Thursday . Hamburg reacted to their slide into the bottom three by appointing Peter Knabel as their new coach during the international break and his first game is a daunting trip to fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. The northern Germany side therefore risk coming out the other side of the weekend inside the bottom two with Paderborn travelling to Hertha Berlin on Sunday.

Speaking on The Morning Show, co-authors of 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way', Charlotte Carr and Helen Padarin said they are 'confident' about the changes they have made to the book since it was branded with major health warnings. The cookbook, which was supposed to be released last Month was delayed before being cancelled completely by Pan Macmillan over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. Scroll down for video . Pete Evans' (pictured) book was dumped by publishers Pan Macmillan after it was revealed that one of the recipes included the ingredients liver and bone broth . We don't want confusion. 'We've taken all of the [health] information on board and applied it to the book' said Carr on the popular morning show. 'We're very confident that this is a very safe, gentle, beautiful book for children,' she said. 'We're really confident that the information we've got in the book is very good information,' Padarin added. 'It is a recipe book, it's not a way of treatment or medicine. If people have issues then yes, of course they should be seeing a practitioner about it.' The pair did address the controversial 'Happy Tummy Brew' recipe which attracted criticism for it's ingredients, claiming they have added more vitamin C to the formula. The recipe is based on a formula by a US health company called Weston A Price. The Paelo Way co-authors Charlotte Carr (centre) and Helen Padarin (right) have spoken out in defence of Pete Evan's (left) decision to release the book independently . Pete Evans is famously known for his role as a judge on My Kitchen Rules alongside Manu Fieldel (left) 'We had just taken the recipe and put it in [the book] and it needed more details,' Carr said. 'Happy Tummy Brew','It was called a formula and by definition it's not a formula - it's a drink - so we've changed [the name] and made it really clear about when it should be implemented in the child's diet so it's really safe.' Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia said there was a 'very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. However, the book is reportedly set for release online amidst the controversy. Australian Women's Weekly recently reported that Naturopath Helen Padarin had been slammed by the Health Care Complaints Commission with sources saying she breached their codes of conduct. Pete Evans has been dropped as the celebrity ambassador for popular salad chain 'Sumo Salad' She reportedly provided incorrect information over the nutritional comparisons between breast milk and baby formula made of liver and bone broth - a recipe in Bubba Yum Yum. Blogger and co-author, Charlotte Carr has also received negative headlines after it was revealed that she has been doing voice-overs for fast-food chains KFC, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's whilst promoting a paleo lifestyle. In March, chef Pete Evans declared that he was forging ahead with his plans to release the book independently after being sensationally dumped by his publisher. 'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that 'Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way' will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' Facebook post read at the time. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way is set to be self-published at the end of this month as a digital book . 'We didn't want to wait, too many people are wanting this beautiful treasure trove of nutritional recipes and we are extremely thankful to all our followers and colleagues for their support. 'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.' Pan Macmillan also distanced themselves from the TV chef's baby book, posting a statement to their website to say they would not be publishing the book in any format. Sumo Salad maintains that their decision was not due to Evans' paleo controversies . 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' a statement from the publisher read. The celebrity chef lost another profitable deal at the start of April after being dropped as an ambassador by the national salad chain, Sumo Salad. The food chain strongly denied that the move was related to Evans' recent paleo controversies, and maintained that the decision to not renew his two-year contract was made a long time ago. The head of marketing for Sumo Salad, Petra Orrenius told news.com.au they had a positive collaboration with Pete Evans but had been with him for too long. They have decided to take their marketing in a different direction and this does not include Evans. 'I think often when you're trying to make a difference you have to be a bit radical and stand out.

Having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the year, the Manchester City striker is working hard to rediscover her best form ahead of the finals in Canada in June. England have never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in their three previous World Cup appearances but Duggan, who has 11 goals in 16 games for her country, is convinced Mark Sampson's team can go further this time. England forward Toni Duggan holds aloft the St George's flag as part of the 'Road to Canada' campaign . Duggan pictured in action for the England team during a match earlier this season . She told Sportsmail: 'We don't fear anyone, we have lots of belief. We've come up against the likes of Germany, the USA and Brazil before and one of our aims is to overcome the mental block we seem to get at the quarter-final stage. 'We play with freedom, we have no fear and we enjoy expressing ourselves. I don't think you've seen the best of England yet and we have so many different goalscorers. We're getting better all the time.' St George's Day allows Duggan the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of her England career so far, with highlights including hat-tricks for the Three Lions against Turkey and Montenegro in qualification for the finals. In all, she found the net on 10 occasions as England coasted through their qualification group with 10 wins from 10 in the perfect start to Sampson's tenure after he replaced Hope Powell following the 2013 European Championships. In the process, England scored a remarkable 52 goals and the task now is to translate that prolific scoring form into the tournament itself. Duggan said: 'It was the perfect qualfying campaign for us, the whole team pulled together and we were able to get 10 wins out of 10. Mark Sampson came in as coach and took everything in his stride. 'It was nice to score 10 goals myself and that included my first hat-trick, against Turkey, which was a nice feeling. Duggan chases for the ball during a Women's Super League match with former club Everton . The 23-year-old gained previous tournament experience with England at the 2013 European Championships . 'We conceded just the one goal, which is obviously almost perfect and I think we showed that we have strength in the squad from No 1 to No 23 and that's what you need at a World Cup.' But just as her thoughts were starting to turn towards the new Women's Super League season and the World Cup in Canada beyond, Duggan suffered the worst injury of her career. The knee problem kept her on the sidelines for eight weeks, required surgery and ruined pre-season plans. It left Duggan needing to prove her form and fitness to the England management team all over again. She said: 'The timing was very unfortunate, coming in a World Cup year. It really killed my confidence and was difficult to deal with because it was the first time. 'I needed major surgery and missed pre-season but I knew it was going to be a big year for both Manchester City and England and it has made me appreicate my time on the pitch a little more. 'I'd like to think I'm good enough to make the World Cup squad but Mark will definitely have a selection headache because it is such a good group. But I will put in the hard work and hopefully will get in.' She made her Three Lions return in the recent friendly with China, playing the last half-hour of a confidence-boosting 2-1 success on her home ground of Manchester City's Academy Stadium. Duggan scored 10 times in a World Cup qualification campaign that saw England with a 100 per cent record . Manchester City are among the favourites for the Women's Super League title this year . June 9 France . June 13 Mexico . June 17 Colombia . Hailing from Liverpool, Duggan started out at Everton Ladies, working her way through the youth ranks and into the senior side during the 2007-08 season. She didn't look back, becoming a first-team regular and earning a first England cap in September 2012 having gained tournament experience at under 19 and under 20 level. Duggan was then signed by City in 2013 as they started out in the Women's Super League. They announced themselves as a force in the game by winning the Continental Cup and are set to challenge for the WSL title this year. Duggan said: 'We won the Continental Cup last season and hopefully we can continue that in the Super League this year. We need to be more consistent over a longer period. 'The title race is going to be a close one but we've made a good start and are positive about our chances. 'We have a winning mentality at City that goes hand-in-hand with England. It's an honour to play for them and we have a fantastic opportunity to go out and win trophies.' On her journey with England, which she hopes will inspire the next generation, Duggan adds: 'It is a dream come true for me to represent my country. 'To be in the first team for England hopefully to be on the verge of a World Cup call-up. As a kid, I didn't even know there was an England team for women so wearing that shirt, whether it's your first cap or your 25th, is amazing.'

Cosmic rays constantly bombard Earth’s atmosphere, and there have been some suggestions they could even trigger lightning. But this particular experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it - providing information on the electrical field of a given storm. Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope. They found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays (illustrated). A storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres. The method could provide a novel way to understand thunderclouds . The experiment was conducted using the Lofar (Low-Frequency Array) radio telescope in the Netherlands. Researchers found, almost by accident, that cosmic rays were a suitable probe to measure electric fields within thunderclouds. High in the atmosphere, the rays strike atmospheric molecules and create ‘showers’ of elementary particles - the smallest known to exist. A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. These showers can be measured from the radio emissions that are generated when they interact with Earth’s magnetic field. By measuring this during a thunderstorm, the researchers found they could find out information about the electric field in a thundercloud as it affected the radio emissions. It was found to be as strong as 50 kilovolts per one metre (3.3ft) - which translates into a voltage of hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres, an enormous amount of energy. 'We modeled how the electric field in thunderstorms can explain the different measurements,’ said researcher Dr Pim Schellart from Radboud University in the Netherlands. ‘This worked very well. How the radio emission changes gives us a lot of information about the electric fields in thunderstorms. ‘We could even determine the strength of the electric field at a certain height in the cloud.’ Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovae (illustrated), but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well . Lightning is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims many victims around the world each year. This new method to measure electric fields in thunderclouds will contribute to a better understanding and ultimately better predictions of lightning activity. Current measurement methods from planes, balloons or little rockets are dangerous and too localised. Most importantly, the presence of the measurement equipment influences the measurements too. Cosmic rays probe the thunderclouds from top to bottom. Moving at almost the speed of light they provide a near instantaneous 'picture' of the electric fields in the cloud. Moreover, they are created by nature and are freely available. 'This research is an exemplary form of interdisciplinary collaboration between astronomers, particle physicists and geophysicists', said Dr Heino Falcke, also from Radboud University. 'We hope to develop the model further to ultimately answer the question: how is lightning initiated within thunderclouds?' Lightning (shown in Utah) is a highly unpredictable natural phenomenon that inflicts damage to infrastructure and claims victims around the world.

Little did she know she would never get the chance to wear it, despite already paying for half. The 31-year-old said when she slipped into the white lacy gown, she instantly saw herself standing in front of her friends and family and exchanging marriage vows with the love of her life. ‘I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Adele McKenzie was set to marry the love of her life, David Elliot, when she was devastated to learn the bridal company she had paid around $1,000 to for her dress had closed down . Ms McKenzie said she wasn't able to buy the $2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with ‘The Bridal Centre’. She started paying in February and planned to pay off her dress by July - around three months before her wedding - giving her time to make alterations. In early April, Ms McKenzie’s dress dream was shattered when she opened an email from the bridal company that said they were going bankrupt. Ms McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia she was left feeling ‘panicked’ and ‘anxious’ when she was faced with the news that she would need to find a new wedding dress for her big day. ‘My first reaction was to call The Bridal Centre and it was consistently busy across the long weekend. Their Facebook was active and we were putting up posts without a response.' The Bridal Centre's Facebook page was inundated with messages from disappointed brides who already had their hearts set on a wedding dress . Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same ‘generic’ email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with their weddings only weeks away. She tried to go onto the Bridal Centre's website but it was deactivated and that's when she realised she had no way of getting in contact with the company she already paid $1,000, which was meant to go towards paying off her dress. The happy couple have been together for nine years and plan to wed in November 2015 . ‘It was stressful and pretty upsetting,’ she said. Ms McKenzie was one of around 140 brides who received the same ‘generic’ email informing them their dream dresses may not be coming, some of them with weddings only weeks away. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie said the group called ‘Where’s My Dress?’ became inundated with ‘generous offers’ from ‘lovely ladies’ and ‘amazing bridal companies’ who offered them free ‘pre-loved’, and even brand new, wedding gowns. While some women have received their money back, unfortunately Ms McKenzie said she is still waiting to hear from the Bridal Centre about whether she will be one of the lucky ones who can use that money to buy another dress. Ms McKenzie revealed she would need another $1,000 deposit to move forward with a different dress, however at this stage, with all the financial pressure that comes with planning a wedding, she isn't sure she can afford it. ‘It’s very difficult financially, I can’t take the next step to get another dress. I don’t know if I’m going to get it back.’ ‘I am six months out of my wedding and I’m anxious and stressed out,' she said. Amid the devastation, the brides-to-be banded together to create a Facebook page that would allow them to 'connect' and 'support each other' through the confusing time. Ms McKenzie is expecting around 70 guests at her wedding that will be held in Sydney's Terrey Hills, with some travelling from interstate and overseas. 'There’s a lot of planning and it’s added pressure on top.' 'It’s getting more difficult as the weeks draw closer,’ she added. Ms McKenzie said the trusting brides had no idea the company was facing financial difficulties as they continued to take payments from their clients right up until the day before they sent the email that notified them of their money woes. ‘[It] is just disgraceful. They knew what was happening. If they didn't want to tell us the truth, that’s fine, but don’t take our money,’ she said. ‘At the end of the day, I’m marrying the man of my dreams so I’m trying to not let it affect it too much.’ After thinking she had secured the dress she had dreamed of since she was a little girl, Ms McKenzie said she was devastated she was going to have to fight to get it back. ‘You find this dress and you fall in love with it. Now I have to go through this process, it’s so upsetting. ‘I don’t want this,’ she added. Ms McKenzie said despite her awful experience she is trying to move forward and instead focus on on the man who will be standing at the end of the aisle, regardless of what she is wearing. ‘At the end of the day, I’m marrying the man of my dreams so I’m trying to not let it affect it too much.’", "reference_summary": "The Bridal Centre, in Brisbane, shut down unexpectedly earlier this month .

A 'model' poses in a makeshift hammock for a portrait by puppy photographer John Daniels . The photographer also experiments with some unusual animal pairings, making his charming snaps the perfect way to celebrate National Pet Day, which takes place tomorrow. John said: 'I use the studio because I can't rely on the British weather, I've had to cancel shoots in the past, so using the studio and building a set means its one less thing to worry about. 'Photographing any animal can be tricky and with shoots outside there is more chance of the animal escaping or being frightened by the big outdoors. 'I have very good animal handlers that I use, they have lots of contacts in the animal world and tell me what's available at any time. Some of his work is the stuff of dreams for greetings card makers, such as these four puppies in socks hung up on a washing line . Two tiny Shar Pei's sit back to pack for this adorable, very wrinkly photo . John applies the time tested 'baby in a bucket' pose to a little puppy (l) - the photographer is seen on a farm with his camera (r) 'The hardest part is timing, I have to get each animal at the right age, so hatching eggs to coincide with kittens or puppies takes a bit of planning. 'I've found that the older the animal is the harder it is to get it to sit with another, when they are very young they don't really know whats going on, and a ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy. 'I never force an animal to do anything, so if they don't look happy it wont look good in the picture and we try something else, or give them time to settle. Some of John's 'barking mad' animal pairings include this puppy and duck saying hello to one another. He says 'A ducking will happily snuggle up to a kitten or anything else that feels cosy' Some are captured in a precious moment where they look tired or relaxed, sleepy or barely awake . 'Without giving away any trade secrets, I use sounds to attract them, they have to be soft for kittens but a little louder for puppies and others, or strange to get them to look at the camera. 'All the animals react in different ways, so its quite often trial and error. 'I love working with any animal, wild or domestic, its a privilege to be able to. 'I hope they enjoy working with me, many of the animals come back to the studio for several shoots and they do seem to remember what to do, little treats always help.'

A playful pup sticks out his tongue to the camera (l) while another seems to be sleeping in a milk jug (r) Many of John's subjects appear to be almost newborn - their eyes completely coloured and their fur still fuzzy, not yet silky .

The electrifying winger has dazzled for the Eagles since Alan Pardew took over in January and has been watched by Liverpool and Newcastle this season. Bolasie has the opportunity to shine against Manchester City on Monday night and his manager - who was firm in the stance that it would take astronomical money to tempt Palace into selling - wants the 25-year-old to continue honing his skills at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace are convinced Yannick Bolasie will learn from Wilfried Zaha’s mistakes and not jump ship .

I actually think top clubs probably appreciate that.’ Zaha made the £10million switch to Manchester United two seasons ago but managed just two Premier League starts under David Moyes and sealed a permanent move back home this February after impressing on loan. Many point towards Zaha’s troubling spell in the north-west as serving only to curb his development, and Pardew believes last week’s announcement of post-tax profits of £17m means Bolasie will stay in south London when clubs inevitably come knocking this summer. He has two years to run on his contract. Zaha made just four appearances for Manchester United in two years with the club . Louis Van Gaal told Zaha he wasn't part of his plans after Capital One Cup snub . ‘He is a player who can change games and it brings unbelievable value to him. It’ll have to be a very, very big fee trust me,’ Pardew added. ‘The club is on a great financial footing. We are trying not just to improve the team but the facilities. It is not just the stadium but here at the training ground and grow the club as quickly as we can. ‘We have got a good base of players here and three or four additions to the group in the summer, we could be strong candidates for the top ten.’ Pardew admits it would have to take a very, very big fee to lure Bolasie away from Selhurst Park .", "reference_summary": "Winger Yannick Bolasie has excelled under new manager Alan Pardew .

But doctors are concerned with the increasing trend that's seeing people cut whole food groups out of their diets, especially healthier options like wholegrains. As revealed by the Daily Mail on Tuesday, experts warn that shunning an entire food group is unsustainable, can damage one's relationship with food and could be doing more harm than good. Australian dietician and nutritionist Susie Burrell agrees with the research that points to white bread and heavily processed carbohydrates as contributors for weight gain, but says this is no reason to cut all carbs out completely.

'Bread has been a dietary staple for thousands of years, and the more advanced technology has become, so too the more processed our bread, resulting in the soft, almost sticky common white loaf many families base a number of meals around each day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bread, white or otherwise is a rich source of B group vitamins which are crucial for energy production, and hence bread remains a major contributor to energy and the running of energy systems in the body. 'Less processed varieties of bread also offer a range of other nutrients including dietary fibre, Vitamin E, zinc; iron and long chain unsaturated fats, which is generally why loaves of grain based bread contain more fat than white bread,' she added. The nutritionist said there is a distinct difference in the nutritional value of white and grain bread, there's also a disparity in the glycaemic index (GI). The best: Tip Top 9 Grain (right) and Helga's Lower Carb (right) came highly recommended from Susie Burrell . 'As white, wholemeal and flat breads have all had the grains ground down in their processing, they have a relatively high GI compared to wholegrain bread, meaning that they release glucose into the bloodstream much more quickly than wholegrain breads,' Ms Burrell said. 'Over time, this means that choosing processed breads as a dietary staple will be resulting in regular glucose peaks and troughs, and subsequent insulin release. 'High insulin levels over time are related to weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,' she added. This comes as experts in the UK have warned of the long-term effects of completely cutting out one food group from your daily diet. In light of this the diet guru has compiled a list of the five most nutritious, and five worst breads Australian consumers can buy. BarleyMax wraps also rated highly on the Australian nutritionist's list, coming in third in her top five . Baker's Delight Cape Seed loaf (left) was given the nod by the nutritionist, as was Burgen's Soy Lin (right) 'One of the most commonly asked questions in relation to bread choice is whether ‘wholemeal’ is a good choice. While whole meal bread does contain more dietary fibre than standard white bread, it is still a high GI choice,' Ms Burrell revealed. Swap it: Australian nutritionist Susie Burrell says while too many processed carbohydrates can be bad, people shouldn't generally be eliminating them entirely but instead looking at healthier options . She said Turkish breads can be one of the worst as people tend to eat it in higher quantities and fill the holes with butter or margarine. 'The average adult will need just 2-4 slices of bread each day and be mindful of the increasing sizes,' the nutritionist warned. 'Some large, thick slices of bread can contain up to double the amount of carbohydrates and are really not necessary for the majority of us who would ultimately like to drop a few extra kilograms. 'As many Australians eat bread on a daily basis, it is imperative that our choice of bread is gold standard, and this means grain bread,' she added. Ms Burrell also warned parents to be cautious of the bread they're serving their children, as they will learn what they know. 'If you continue to buy white bread, they will continue to eat it, and it is not the best choice nutritionally for their health long term,' she said. While it's widely accepted that processed carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, can contribute to weight gain and its associated diseases, doctors are increasingly concerned about a trend for excluding all carbs - even healthier wholegrains, where the grain is left intact and not processed. People who do this could suffer from a lack of energy, mood swings, poor concentration and gut problems - and may even put on weight. Those who shun carbs say they are bad for us because they convert into sugar in the body, and can cause weight gain because we store excess sugar as fat. Lawson white bread was named as the worst nutritionally, due to its high calorie and sodium counts . Lebanese bread (left) and Turkish bread (right) were also listed unfavourably by Ms Burrell . But while many experts agree that overweight people often do eat too many carbs, they also say that these foods have been unfairly demonised. 'Carbs are seen by many as the \"devil\" food, but any dietitian will tell you they are an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet - the general guidance is they should make up a third of our intake,' says Helen Bond, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'They are a ready source of fuel for the body. Cutting them out can cause headaches, tiredness and lethargy. 'You won't be able to perform so well during exercise and concentration is likely to be affected, too, because carbohydrates also fuel the brain.' She adds that where people go wrong is in treating all carbs as the same. Burgen Soya & Linseed Bread . Calories: 111kcal . Carbs: 12g . Fibre: 4.1g . Sodium: 0.13g .

But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years . The remarkable finding of ‘foreign DNA’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as ‘nature’s genetic engineer.’ It is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. This so-called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans (stock image shown) Sweet potato (shown) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old . ‘The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,’ said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. ‘It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.’ The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process. The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans. However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands. ‘In comparison to \"natural\" GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,’ said Dr Gheysen.", "reference_summary": "Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes contain 'foreign DNA' Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species .

Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe.

'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.'

It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for £60 online.

The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own – but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what’s best for the other person. If you’re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can’t do that, you’re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden – suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner’s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date. Be selfless: One cab driver said people should always think about how they can make their partners happy . New York cabbies understand that dating in the Big Apple can be a complete and utter nightmare. Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won’t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don’t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'. And while marrying a complete stranger may seem absurd, FYI's popular reality show Married at First Sight, which is in its second season, enlists participants to do just that. Two out of the three couples from the show's first season are still together, which probably wouldn't surprise Musaf.

Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi (pictured at an court appearance in December) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail. Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected. 'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP. Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said. A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'. Earlier this month, a Cairo court confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence. The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday. 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi. It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi.' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers. Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16. Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012. Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms. The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces. Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown. Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy. Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth. But Sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against Mubarak. In November, a court dropped murder charges against Mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011.", "reference_summary": "A court in Cairo has sentenced the former leader over abuses of protesters .

This increases the risk of epilepsy, autism and breast cancer. Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30, and the researchers say older would-be fathers should be better informed about the risks of conditions that can occur in their offspring. Whereas the menopause marks the end of reproduction, men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and, according to the new research from doctors at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, and other centres, this could have implications for the next generation. Men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and this could have implications for the next generation . Worldwide data from more than 60 teams of researchers on the health risks associated with older fathers found that men aged over 35 had a 50 per cent lower chance of conceiving over a 12-month period than men 25 and under, even after taking into account the age of the would-be mother. The risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rises when the man is more than 40. A study of 23,821 pregnant women analysed by the researchers found that pregnancies involving men aged 50 or older were twice as likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger fathers. And the problems may not end with conception. Advanced paternal age (over 40) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent, according to one of the studies the American researchers looked at (one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer). Children conceived by fathers over 40 also have a 30 per cent increased risk of epilepsy, a 37 per cent higher risk of Down's syndrome, a 14 per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia, and a 70 per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancers (such as brain tumours). If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer. Older fathers are thought to be at higher risk of having children with autism and schizophrenia. If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer . Some of the biggest increases in risk are seen in genetic disorders. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is nearly eight times more prevalent in the children of fathers aged 50 and over. So, why might this be? In order to produce new sperm, so-called sperm 'precursor' cells have to divide. They do this every 16 days, which means by the time a man reaches 70, these cells will have divided around 1,500 times. With each division comes a risk of DNA mutation and genetic defects. A study from Iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 DNA mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually, reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men, increasing the risk of problems. Another explanation is that, after the age of 60, a high percentage of sperm is affected by so-called DNA fragmentation. Normally, the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strands of DNA breaking. When the genetic material is not safely packaged, the DNA strands are vulnerable to breakage, or DNA fragmentation, which means the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and, in some cases, become unviable. With age, a man's testosterone levels also drop, with one in five men over 60 having low levels, leading to poor semen quality, which can affect conception rates. Advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects, say the Baylor researchers, whose study is being published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr Simon Fishel, chief executive of CARE Fertility, says: 'Even though men keep producing sperm, the decline in sperm DNA with age is now uncontroversial, with potentially devastating effects on the offspring of older men. 'It is not as marked or obvious an effect that we observe in women, which makes it all the more insidious and risky for populations in which men are reproducing later in life. 'This study is telling us we need to sit up and take note, and start to educate the public on the risks of the male biological clock, and not just the female.' Women are generally counselled that as they reach their late-30s, their risk of not just conceiving, but of having a healthy child decreases as the quality and quantity of their eggs deteriorate. At 35, a woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down's syndrome is about one in 350, but by age 45, it is about one in 30. Yet currently, patients are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risks to their offspring, but this should change, says Dr Dolores Lamb, director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Professor of Urology and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. 'The medical community must do a better job of educating couples that there are some risks associated with conception at advanced paternal age,' she says. One issue will be identifying the age at which problems may occur. One study the researchers looked at, which set out to find a cut-off age for men, found that semen quality declined continuously with age, with no point at which risk suddenly increased.", "reference_summary": "Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30 .

Speaking at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Friday night, Justice Diana Bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment. She said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia, hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas. Scroll down for video . A top judge in Brisbane has said that surrogacy laws need to be overhauled to prevent a repeat of the baby Gammy (pictured with his mother) case . 'I personally think we should regulate and allow commercial surrogacy in Australia,' she said. 'If we allow it in Australia, we then can regulate it and ensure that it's done on ethical terms.' Her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases, where parents have refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals. This week an Australian couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their Indian surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins. Documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Justice Diana Bryant (pictured) has spoken out about Australia's surrogacy laws . The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. They was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. The Indian case is similar to the controversial baby Gammy scenario. Gammy was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother, however after reportedly learning that he had a disability, his Australian parents, West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell, only brought his twin sister home with them. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. Following these cases the Thai government passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. Currently in Australia, it is illegal for women to act as surrogates, except in the Northern Territory where there are no laws in place to stop the act. In NSW, ACT and Queensland, arranging a contracted surrogacy overseas is also considered a criminal offence. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell . 'I think the Government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into Australia,' Justice Bryant said. Justice Bryant also said Australian surrogacy should be legalised as many of the children who are currently born to surrogates overseas will never get the chance to meet their biological mothers. 'That child is never going to know their biological mother, and in those cases, there is absolutely no opportunity for them ever to find out,' she said. 'The knowing the biological parentage for me would be one of the first steps and I think we have a responsibility as a country to make sure the worse aspects of commercial surrogacy are overcome.'", "reference_summary": "Top judge said Australian commercial surrogacy needs to be legalised .

The Magpies slumped to a sixth straight defeat at home to Spurs last weekend amid an atmosphere of unrest after thousands of supporters boycotted the match in protest at a lack of ambition and investment from owner Mike Ashley. Fans group AshleyOut.com are now encouraging supporters to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ when Swansea visit St James’ Park on Saturday. This will involve a 34th-minute protest in recognition of the £34million which was last week revealed to be sitting in the club’s bank.

Some of them were annoyed that people had stayed away, others were delighted. It was strange,’ he said. ‘When it all kicked off last year you knew where you stood. This wasn’t a nice situation to be in, it was uncomfortable. ‘There was a lot of apprehension around the place on Sunday.

At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . However, he hopes that the club make a swift announcement on the future of the managerial position. ‘That would be for everyone’s benefit,’ said Carver when asked if the week after the season’s end was the best time to resolve the current uncertainty. ‘The fans, myself, everyone could enjoy their summer. I think it will be (sorted quickly) because don’t forget the window opens very soon after the season finishes. It has to be done and your recruitment has to be done in that period of time.’ He added: ‘I don’t know (if it will be me).

But every time I get together with them they are positive – whether that’s to keep me going or they have someone else lined up, I don’t know. ‘That doesn’t affect me, the future will take care of itself.

The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean. It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . On one side there is a horse’s head, while the other bears the image of the goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage. Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Sardinia or ancient Carthage. The find suggests that the village of Saltford, where it was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times. On one side of the coin there the image of the Goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, (pictured left) while on the reverse is a horse’s head, pictured right . The find suggests that the village of Saltford (shown on the map with a red marker), where the coin was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times . It is believed there was a ford in the area, which made it the only place to cross the river Avon at the time. One side of the coin shows an image of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, suggesting links between the south west and the Mediterranean . The coin is thought to be the oldest dateable evidence of human activity found in Saltford and the West of England. It suggests Iron Age links between the Mediterranean and the Bristol Channel, which the River Avon flows into around 15 miles (24km) away. Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist and Roman historian at the University of Leicester said: ‘It’s really interesting to have a Carthaginian coin in Britain. ‘Suppose that coin was deposited close to its minting - at the time, there were no coins being used in Britain. It would have been quite alien to people. ‘We are very sure that horses were important at the time so that may have invoked a lot of interest back then. It’s a very interesting find.’ Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin’s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. ‘Only eight of these have ever been found, always on ancient trade routes,’ he said. ‘We can’t believe it. We thought we would be writing the history of Saltford from the Roman times to now. ‘But now we have to go back to the Iron Age. It’s absolutely fantastic.’ Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. It was the first time that coins from the two separated groups have been found buried together. Archaeologists discovered 26 coins, including three Roman coins which pre-date the invasion of Britain in 43 AD, and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are Late Iron Age and thought to belong to the Corieltavi tribe. Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins (pictured) were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years . National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache was probably a wealthy and influential figure. 'The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. ‘Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. ‘...The situation of the cave can’t be ignored either. Could it have been a sacred place to the Late Iron Age peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life, making it a safe place that would ensure that person’s valuables were protected?'", "reference_summary": "Tiny copper coin is dated to the Iron Age, almost 2,300 years ago .

The Labour leader visited the Gurdwara – a Sikh temple – during a campaign tour of the Midlands on Wednesday. But his team banned national media journalists from the event – despite the fact that Gurdwaras are traditionally open to all. Worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the Labour leader, who had donned a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs. Scroll down for video . Behind closed doors: Ed Miliband, donning a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs, in secret footage from the Gurdwara . During the visit, Mr Miliband would answer only a small number of questions from the Sikh press. But even one of the Sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave Labour's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions. Davinder Singh, an adviser to the Sikh Federation who attended the visit, said the attitude of the Labour leader's team went against the ethos of his faith. He said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a Gurdwara are always open to all. And he suspected the Labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head-covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was 'offensive, even touching on racism'. He told the Daily Mail: 'The whole thing was very carefully stage managed. They said there will be no cameras whatsoever, they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a Gurdwara. Some of the party officials were downright rude. 'My children, who are three and six, were ushered out of the way. The whole thing did not feel right. 'It was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended. You don't do that in a Gurdwara – usher people around.' The incident will increase concern about the 'controlling' nature of Labour's election campaign, in which the Press and members of the public are kept at arm's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the Tories. Public visit: David Cameron at the Golden Temple in Amritsar . Mr Singh said he suspected Mr Miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the Sikh community but was 'worried about the reaction of non-Sikhs' if he was seen in the headgear at the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara. 'There's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the Sikh community,' he added. 'They wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a Gurdwara – but that he didn't want the publicity to go any wider.' Mr Singh, whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten-point Sikh Manifesto, said it was disappointing that Mr Miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about Labour's stance on Sikh issues. He added: 'Labour told the media it was a private visit, but that's nonsense. Was he going there for prayers? Of course not – it was part of the campaign.' Labour dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers. But it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent Mr Miliband creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run-up to the General Election. He has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past, including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader. Sky News broadcast footage on Wednesday evening showing the doors of the Gurdwara being closed after Mr Miliband entered. Only an official Labour Party photographer was allowed inside, and pictures were not released to the national media. The only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper. It showed that once inside, Mr Miliband took off his shoes and donned a red head-covering known as a ramal. He was also presented with a traditional orange scarf, or siropa, which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries. Broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused. But Mr Miliband held a brief Press briefing for three journalists from the Sikh media on Labour's battlebus. They were told they could each ask one question, which was agreed in advance. But a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question. He was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. A journalist from the Sikh media asked Mr Miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar (file picture used) Shalbinder Singh Malle, secretary of the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara, which co-operated with Labour over the visit, insisted worshippers were not offended by the event. He added: 'It went smoothly and we felt it was a success. 'We were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but I wouldn't say anyone was upset or offended by it. No one complained.' The row risks provoking cynicism about Mr Miliband's motives. Electoral experts believe Britain's 500,000 Sikhs could play a key role at next month's election. A Labour spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous and untrue to say that Ed Miliband did not want to be pictured at the Gurdwara. 'The visit was widely covered by the national and Sikh press and many worshippers took pictures inside with Ed Miliband. 'To respect worshippers in the prayer hall, Ed Miliband gave press interviews, including with the Sikh Federation, outside the temple.' But Mr Singh said the visit contrasted with a visit by David Cameron in February to the Gurdwara, adding: 'People who were there said it was very different. He was more relaxed and people could come and go, which is strange because you'd think the Prime Minister would have much tighter security.' Mr Cameron also visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 2013.", "reference_summary": "Labour leader accused of 'offensive' behaviour during visit to Sikh temple .

The Jackson County jury found Susan Monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart, then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm, The Medford Mail Tribune reported. Circuit Judge Tim Barnack immediately sentenced 66-year-old Monica to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after a minimum of 50 years. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Susan Monica was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering two handymen on her pig farm over a one-year span. She was sentenced to a minimum of 50 years in prison. Pictured above in court on Tuesday . Floored: Monica and her defense team react to hearing a guilty verdict in court on Tuesday . 'You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,' the judge told Monica. 'I don't know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. 'It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer,' Barnack said. Prosecutors said Stephen Delicino, 59, was killed in 2012 and Robert Haney, 56, died in 2013. Monica asked for sentencing as soon as the jury was dismissed, saying 'it doesn't seem to matter.' The case will be appealed, the defense said. Victim: Robert Haney (pictured) is one of the two men Monica was found guilty of killing. She admitted to shooting Haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013, but jurors didn't buy the story . Monica's changing stories about how she shot Delicino and Haney never matched the forensic evidence, Allan Smith, senior assistant deputy district attorney, told jurors in closing arguments. She variously claimed that Delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self-defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20-acre farm in southern Oregon, Smith reminded jurors. Monica told investigators Haney disappeared in the summer of 2013. She said she came on him a month later as pigs were disemboweling him, and she shot him to ease his suffering. She later questioned whether he was alive when she shot him. Defense attorney Garren Pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut Monica's claims that she shot Delicino in self-defense or to show that Haney was actually alive when Monica shot him. Some of his remains were found in plastic bags in her barn. A State Police forensic anthropologist, Veronica Vance, testified that Haney's legs had been chopped off with an ax, and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal. Vance said she couldn't determine whether the ax blows came before or after Haney died. She said Delicino suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head, but there was no evidence one way or another about the self-defense claim. 'Just because Susan Monica is different and strange and weird doesn't make her a murderer,' another defense lawyer, Christine Herbert, told the jury. Gruesome discovery: The remains of the two handymen were found on Monica's farm after investigators noticed she was using one of the men's food stamps . Quick: It took a jury just an hour to come to the decision to convict Monica of murder. Pictured above in court on April 14 . Changing hair: Monica wore a short wig throughout the proceedings. Pictured above in two mugshots, one wearing a long wig and the other bald . At one point during the six-day trial, Monica herself cross-examined sheriff's Detective Eric Henderson, who was the lead investigator in the case, despite having her own defense team. On Monday, a cellmate of Monica's testified the defendant signed a birthday card in jail with this phrase: 'from the sweetest murderer in Jackson County.' 'I got chills from the birthday card,' 23-year-old inmate Jordan 'Janae' Farris testified. Farris was serving time for violating probation from a burglary conviction and met Monica in the Jackson County Jail. Monica said she signed the card in accordance with the charges she was facing, KDRV-TV reported. As the judge addressed the jury before deliberations Tuesday, the newspaper reported that Monica stood up, raised her hand and began asking for the chance to give jurors one more demonstration on how she claimed she shot Delicino. 'I'd like to demonstrate how I shot him for 10 seconds,' Monica said. Barnack initially ignored her. Then Monica put her hands in the air, as she did in her earlier testimony from the stand, and said, 'I held the gun like this.' At that, the judge ordered her back to jail and sheriff's deputies took her away.", "reference_summary": "It took jurors just an hour to convict Susan Monica on the murder charges on Tuesday .

And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo. His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout. Instead, we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table. And a description of John Terry’s performance as ‘from the moon.’ Mourinho patrols the touchline as the Chelsea boss saw his side take another step toward the title . Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one. Something Sky Sports spotted early on was the deal, and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed. And why should they? After all, everyone will be back next year for more of the same. So what’s the rush?", "reference_summary": "Wenger and Mourinho faced off once more as Arsenal and Chelsea contested a 0-0 draw .

The Warriors came out on top 12-4 in a brutal, no-holds-barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the DW Stadium which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest. Defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing Good Friday duel as the ferocious exchanges, on a glue-pot pitch, began to takes its toll. Wigan Warriors' Dom Manfredi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after he scores his side's first try. It took a try from Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions' resistance. It was a second successive defeat for Saints, who began the season under Keiron Cunningham with six wins in a row, but there was no shame in this loss. Cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in Jordan Turner and Lance Hohaia after skipper Jon Wilkin joined Travis Burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while Paul Wellens, restored to the captaincy, limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle, . Wigan could hardly have made a better start, with winger Dom Manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds, reclaiming possession after Turner's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop Lee Mossop. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over St Helens . Matty Smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and Saints had to scramble to prevent Manfredi and his centre Anthony Gelling adding to the Warriors' lead. Wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by George Williams that brought down centre Josh Jones in full flight and, as the momentum shifted towards the visitors, it was no surprise when impressive forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes. Tom Makinson, third choice marskman in the absence of Mark Percival and Burns, was unable to add the goal and Saints suffered a blow when boom second rower Joe Greenwood, just back from an elbow injury, limped off with an ankle problem. As the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in, the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick, touching the ball down with inches to spare. Ryan Hampshire kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter.", "reference_summary": "Wigan exact revenge on St Helens in Super League Grand-Final rematch .

Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .", "reference_summary": "Leicester have recorded three consecutive Premier League wins .

More than one million people have already booked their slots to see the piece of linen that devotees believe to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ between now and June 24. 'Whether you believe or don't believe, there is no doubt it is something special,' said an Italian man who was among the first visitors following the opening mass in the Italian city of Turin. Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia presents the Holy Shroud, which will be on public display until June 24, 2015 . Pilgrims have already made reservations to see the cloth, believed to have been used to wrap Jesus' body . Imprinted with the image of a man who appears to have been crucified, the shroud has been dated to the end of the 13th century, lending support to those who say it is a medieval forgery. But it has retained its mystical air for many thanks partly to the fact that researchers have been unable to establish exactly how the image was created. The Church does not officially maintain that Christ's body was wrapped in the shroud or that any miracles were involved in the creation of the image now on display. But it does value the relic's symbolic value as a powerful representation of Christ's suffering. 'It is not a profession of faith because it is not an object of faith, nor of devotion, but it can help faith,' Turin Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia said earlier this week. Local authorities are counting on the exhibition of the shroud in the city's cathedral to give a significant boost to the local economy at a time of stagnation across Italy. Guards stand by the Turin Shroud as it went back on display for the first time in five years in Turin's cathedral . The 14 foot-long linen has the faded image of a boarded man and has been a source of wonder for centuries . When the shroud was last presented to the public, in 2010, more than two million people filed past it. Pope Francis decreed the latest exhibition to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of St John Bosco, a 19th century monk who devoted his life to the education of poor children in newly-industrialised Turin. Francis, who has family roots in the region, is due to visit the city and the exhibition on June 20-21. The shroud will be on display for 12 hours a day between 7.30am and 7.30pm with an entry free but requiring reservation via the website www.sindone.org or a special call centre.

While Cumberbatch, who was hosting the main event, and 31-year-old Cavill have no clear links to sport, Charlene's own sporting pedigree is impeccable. A successful swimmer, she burst onto the scene in 1999 at the All Africa Games in Johannesburg where she picked up three golds and a silver for her native South Africa. Glamorous gathering: The 37-year-old royal cut an elegant figure during the presentation ceremony . Sporting pedigree: Charlene has an impressive sporting pedigree of her own and was an Olympic swimmer . Chuffed: Mr Djokovic looked suitably thrilled with his Sportsman of the Year award . She went on to compete in the 2000 Olympics but narrowly missed out on the 2008 event after spending 18 months out with shoulder injury. Since marrying Monaco's Prince Albert in July 2011, she has used her position to promote a number of sporting initiatives via the Princess Charlene Foundation. Of these, the best known is a programme that encourages children to learn to swim, while emphasising water safety. Today's outing, for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, dovetails with her own charitable ambitions and promotes excellence in sport, as well as positive social change. Now a mother to four-month-old twins Gabriella Thérèse Marie and Jacques Honoré Rainier, Charlene is attending fewer engagements than previously but remains a familiar sight at sporting events. Surprise guests: Mr Cavill and Mr Cumberbatch chat while showing their support for the sporting event .

Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage . That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.'

Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday . Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.'

Dubbed ‘The Amazing Experience’, it also includes three nights in a five-star hotel in London, transfers and a ticket to the actor’s May 22 show at the Hammersmith Apollo. Pacino fans who find the price too steep can opt for ‘The Unique Experience’, which allows them to eat lunch with the actor at his hotel before the London show, for £7,500 ($12,000). If that is too pricey, fans can buy a £2,500 ($4,150) ticket package that includes about 20 minutes of alone time with Pacino in his dressing room, or they can spend £650 ($1,080) for a group meet and greet.

Skol!\" drew plenty of attention on social media. Some commentators focused on Abbott's drinking technique. But others suggested he was setting a bad example. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. \"Like most Australians, I enjoy a drink on social occasions,\" he said in January 2014. \"However, as a father and as a citizen, I'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent, especially at \"hot spots\" in our big cities.\" Casting those concerns aside, some social media users belittled Abbott's beer swilling.

We're trying to get him to the appropriate facilities in this country but we don't know what the damage to the nerve is. 'There is a significant language barrier so it's quite an isolating experience but Luke is very fit, he's a very fit young man and he and I go to the gym together. 'Hearing the news was the most devastating news, we are slowly coming to terms with it. 'It's sad that these shocking things can happen right out of the blue. It brings too much pain to talk about.' The police officer's mother Stephanie Stanwick, 64, who has a medical background, has flown from the UK to be by her son's side. A donation page, set up by close friend and former Metropolitan Police colleague Alison Cat, has collected more than £8,000 so far. It reached a staggering £5,000 in the first day as colleagues at Sussex Police and officers all over the country rallied together using the hashtag £MayTheForceBeWithU. Secretary of the Sussex Police Federation Mark White said: 'We were saddened to hear about Luke's accident and have been doing our best to help him and his family. 'It is too early to say how this will affect him in the long run and we still live in hope that he make a full recovery. 'In the meantime, it is heart-warming to see the efforts which are already underway to raise funds to support Luke and his family.' The Bullshire Police Federation, a website for the police community, shared the GoFundMe page and encouraged officers to help Luke on his road to recovery. On the post, Sean Board wrote: 'I worked on relief with Luke. You couldn't wish to meet a more dedicated officer and family man. 'Come on guys let's dig in and show him his extended family are here for him.' Andrew Smith said: 'Luke worked for me on his arrival in the Met some time ago. A top guy, now is the time he and his family need our support however little people can spare.' Kelly Campbell Jones added: 'Luke and Jen are such a lovely couple. This is a horrible situation but they have so much support and both have the determination to get through this. 'Hope the money helps on Luke's road to recovery.' Graeme McKee said: 'This is awful. I was at a job just a few weeks ago when Luke was a superb example of 'good cop'. 'This guy is a gentleman and an example to us all.'

After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal. The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.' That's the beautiful thing about how the franchise has evolved.\"", "reference_summary": "The film's cast is diverse . EW points out that Hollywood still needs to catch up .

Writing on her amusingly frank and startlingly honest blog morethanyourbag.com, Hattie opens up about life after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Hattie Gladwell was fitted with an ostomy bag after under-going surgery for ulcerative colitis, now she shares her experience on her blog morethanyourbag.com . She reveals all about what it's like to wear a bikini for the first time, how to have sex with a bag and how learning to live with it has affected her mental health. Hattie was admitted to hospital on January 26th of this year although she had long suffered from problems with her health after an inflammatory bowel condition was misdiagnosed. She told MailOnline: 'I was sent into hospital with suspected appendicitis, but after two failed colonoscopies, my appendix out and excruciating pain, I finally had emergency surgery for my stoma. 'The cause turned out to be ulcerative colitis but the symptoms had been fobbed off as \"women's troubles\" for years.' Ulcerative colitis is a long term condition where the colon and the rectum become inflamed and things became so bad for Hattie, she had to have her colon removed and an ileostomy bag fitted into her small intestine. She found the change to her body difficult to deal with. She said: 'At first, I was scared I wouldn't be able to live a normal life. I was scared of what people would think, and how I could go on to hide it. Hattie says that her boyfriend has been a great support - on her blog she details how the couple have maintained their sex life with her bag . 'For the first few weeks I was unable to look down at my stomach without wanting to cry. 'At only 19, there is so much pressure to be attractive to society that I wasn't sure I would cope with something that wasn't deemed \"normal\".' The ostomy bag would collect waste from Hattie's body which had been diverted through her stoma. But before long brave Hattie decided that she could not let the operation or her bag ruin her life. She said: 'A couple of weeks after surgery, I decided the worst thing I could do to myself was hide such a traumatic experience. 'My stoma is a part of me now it is what saved my life and I have no reason to be ashamed of that.' Hattie has a stoma (left) through which waste passes from her body into her bag (right) Hattie has opened up about what it was like to wear her bikini again for the first time since she had her bag fitted saying she felt happy to be in the water . She her blog which she explains is, 'a blog for those getting used to life with a stoma.' She said: 'Since speaking out, I have come to terms with my body and the change it has faced. I have become determined to make sure my life doesn't change. And I love it. 'I've never felt more open minded, I've never appreciated life more. My life hasn't changed in the slightest, if anything, I've changed. I've become more confident after choosing to embrace my body. 'I've become more understanding, and now all I want to do is raise awareness for IBD [inflammatory bowel disease] and ostomy.' Hattie revealed that she's had a huge amount of support from her friends and family, especially her mother. She said: 'My mum was pretty much my rock during the whole thing. She spent the first couple of weeks helping me with my bag before I became more independent again. I wouldn't have coped without her.'

But although I started off feeling self-conscious I quickly realised that this is the body that I will be living with, and that if I wanted to do things deemed as \"normal\" I needed to get over any flaws I feel are there.' Hattie continued: 'I also needed to forget about what other people may or may not think. Because it's not their opinion that is going to keep me going – it's mine. 'I decided to wear a bikini because I remembered how good I felt wearing it last year - my first ever bikini that I'd had the courage to buy after being so body conscious for so long. 'I remembered how little fear I felt when people looked at me. I didn't want to fall back into that place where I'd hide in my towel as soon as I got out of the water. 'I told myself that my stoma is nothing to be ashamed of. So I wore the bikini that made me feel beautiful last year, and instead of falling two steps back, I moved one step further towards that self esteem I so desperately want to maintain.' Hattie plans to keep her blog going full time and says that she hopes to raise more awareness of people living with an ostomy bag . Hattie shared another photo of herself with her ostomy bag attached to her stomach . Describing the moment she headed for the pool Hattie said: 'I left the changing rooms and walked over to the pool. As my is scar very prominent I was expecting stares and fingers. But my expectations were wrong. 'Nobody stared, nobody pointed. I slowly got into the pool – not wanting to jump in, in case the pressure of the water caused my bag to float away. 'I was able to get into the pool with ease and began swimming. The water felt amazing. I couldn't even feel my bag while in the water. 'It was as if for that amount of time none of this year had happened, no surgery, no stoma, no bag. I was taken back to last year, I felt as if I was back on that same day where I felt absolutely amazing. 'I swam a few lengths before getting out to use the steam room. I was a little breathless as it was the most exercise I'd done in a while.' Hattie also says that her boyfriend Angelo Caponi has been a big part of rebuilding her confidence. She said: 'My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, meeting early 2013. We live together so there's not really much choice but to be open with him about everything. 'Which has actually been great for me as I feel so comfortable with my body around him. Our sex life hasn't changed one bit. 'Of course, the first few weeks we were very cautious and he was a bit wary as he didn't want to hurt me. 'But for me, sex was never an issue. We always had such an active sex life before the surgery and I didn't want that to change.'

But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. \"The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,\" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. \"We know how to address disease when we find it.\" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low\" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. \"That said, human infections have occurred\" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. \"We are cautiously optimistic\" that it won't spread to humans, but \"we are prepared for the possibility,\" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called \"torticollis\" or \"stargazing\" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus.

But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. \"The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,\" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. \"We know how to address disease when we find it.\" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low\" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. \"That said, human infections have occurred\" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. \"We are cautiously optimistic\" that it won't spread to humans, but \"we are prepared for the possibility,\" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called \"torticollis\" or \"stargazing\" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA.

The list price of Bentleys ranges from £136,250 to £224,700, yet the manufacturer and Porsche finished bottom of a 38-strong table judged on reliability . Thousands of cars aged three to eight years old were assessed on their failure rate, age, mileage and cost of repairs.

The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him.

Two mothers have slammed police for failing to act after their daughters were targeted by an online predator. Both Lesley Conman and Kerry Green's young daughters were sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on Facebook - but police refused to investigate as no offence had been committed. Ms Conman's daughter Abbie, 12, was sent a message by the man after accepting a friend request from someone pretending to be a 17-year-old boy. After the horrified mother saw the provocative messages, she challenged the man herself, pretending to be Abbie. Ms Conman, 34, from Hull, said: 'There were four or five messages that he sent, before he actually blocked me. I think I scared him. 'You can only find my daughter on Facebook if you have a mutual friend and this guy was friends with 100 of her school friends, so she thought he was from school.' After tackling the pervert, Lesley posted the messages on her own account to warn other parents of the dangerous predator. She said: 'I shared it because I would say 90 per cent of my daughter's school were on his profile and he was talking to her friends and his profile had about 300-400 friends and they were all under 15.' In the case of Ms Green's daughter Emily, 13, the sick man threatened to post explicit pictures on her Facebook wall - which all of her friends would have then seen - if she did not play along with his sordid messages. The pictures were not of Emily, but it is thought that he planned to post them online as if they were her. Ms Green, from North Newbald, East Yorkshire, said: 'When I first saw the messages I flipped out, but I didn't to play the role of a paedophile hunter and lead him on because I didn't want him to think that my daughter was interested in him in anyway at all.' Ms Conman challenged the man (pictured left and writing in grey) when she found the messages on Abbie's Facebook (Abbie's messages in blue) After the horrified mother saw the provocative messages, she challenged (in blue) the man (writing in grey) herself, pretending to be Abbie .

If nothing is done then surely we are sending a message out to these men that this is acceptable.' Ms Green, who says the police never responded to her complaint, said: 'It was upsetting and annoying. I understand they can't follow up everyone of these case because it takes a lot of time, but if they did chase them up there would be less of them.' Both mothers admitted that they do not like their daughters being on Facebook, but they'd rather allow it than running the risk of the girls setting up a secret account. A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, there are people out there that do want to engage with people who are younger than themselves. 'Young people can help themselves by not engaging with them. Parents have a role to play in it, children have a role to play in it and we have a role to play in it once a crime has been committed.

Despite having sent down 130 overs in the fourth innings of the drawn first Test, captain Alastair Cook pressed his bowlers back into action, persuaded by humid conditions and a touch of dampness in the pitch. Anderson, who overtook Sir Ian Botham to become the country's leading Test wicket-taker in Antigua last week, made an early down payment on that decision. Jordan celebrates his first wicket of this match, Devon Smith, as the West Indies went to lunch 36 for two . Smith is given out as England players celebrate their second wicket of a rain-shortened first session . He clattered Brathwaite's leg stump having forced the batsman off balance with some prodigious movement through the air. The opener had already seen one edge fall short of the slips off Anderson, who was challenging the bat more readily than Stuart Broad. Broad's opening five overs cost just eight runs but he largely pitched too short to cause concern. Anderson was close to a second when Darren Bravo, defending on the back foot, sent a thick edge in the direction of third slip. Kraigg Brathwaite is first to fall as James Anderson bowls the West Indies opener with a massive in-swinger . Ben Stokes races to celebrate with Anderson after the opening bowler makes the breakthrough . Ben Stokes fell quickly to his right but the ball grounded just in front of him. Jordan saw a tough chance shelled at leg-slip by Gary Ballance, stationed there at Ian Bell's behest, but Smith (15) did not take his luck. He is the first Grenadian to play Test cricket on the island but fell in ignominious fashion, following a wide ball that should have been left with the interval imminent. The confusion over whether or not he had edged it - and why he did not send the decision upstairs - merely added intrigue to a careless exit. The last over before lunch went to Moeen Ali, fit again and recalled in place of James Tredwell.", "reference_summary": "West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite missed the ball but didn't review it .

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it’s a lot of work and it’s also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need - it’s entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children’s diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they’re young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they’re young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they’re not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and they don’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they’re running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that’s really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don’t know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. ‘I’m not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I’m not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it’s okay as well as long as it’s a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There’s sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book, 'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients, has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'", "reference_summary": "UK celebrity cook book author Annabel Karmel shares her thoughts on paleo for kids .

The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time. Yellow Submarine was a success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album a year later . The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. The original cel is set to sell for £10,000 . 'It is a film that has stood the test of time and is as relevant today as when it was made in 1968. The Band Concert is the most expensive cel sold . The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference. 'It would be one of the earliest final versions of the Yellow Submarine hand-painted - it really is the holy grail of Yellow Submarine memorabilia. 'Since small stickers were used for when the sub travelled there are not really a great deal of Yellow Submarine cels out there. 'This comes from a former Yellow Submarine ink and paint department employee. 'It is an unusually large image. Colour model cels were used also to help determine the final approved colour scheme of the yellow submarine.

Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left a memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat in 2010. The memo, found by his Liberal Democrat successor David Laws, said: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid that there is no money. Kind regards and good luck.' Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today finally got round to sending a letter to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy'. It said: 'The deficit halved. Jobs up. Growth up. That's the Liberal Democrat record,' he wrote. 'We won't let you – or the Tories – screw it up!' Scroll down for video . Danny Alexander tweeted a picture of himself with his response to the infamous note left in the Treasury by his Labour predecessor Liam Byrne, saying there was 'no money' left . Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today sent a letter (left) to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply to his original note (right) – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy' The original note has haunted Labour since it was first published in the days after Coalition was formed in 2010. Ed Balls sparked a furious response from David Cameron earlier this month after he dismissed the letter as a 'jokey note'. The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by Mr Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is joined by his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez at The Devonshire Arms in Sheffield today . The Deputy Prime Minister is hoping his message that the Lib Dems can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party's dire position in the polls . He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left the original memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat . Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' The Prime Minister said Mr Balls's response was 'frankly the most appalling thing I have heard in this election campaign so far'. He claimed Balls was Ed Miliband's third choice to be shadow chancellor and was frankly 'the country's last choice to be put in charge of this nation's finances'. He said: 'The note that was left was correct. It said there was no money left. Let us think about the consequences of what we inherited and what we had to do. We had to make difficult decisions, we had to find efficiencies in government spending, we had to put up some taxes. 'We had to make some very very difficult decisions to get this country back on track. That note that said there is no money left was referring to the fact that our budget deficit was forecast to be bigger than the budget deficit in Greece when I became prime minister.'", "reference_summary": "Labour's Liam Byrne left a memo for the incoming Coalition government .

He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs. More recent videos show a frailer performer, seated and without a guitar, but still clearly glorying in the joy of singing a song.", "reference_summary": "Kayahan wrote some of Turkey's best-loved pop songs .

Kevin Bollaert, 28, was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. One victim said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said.

In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down (picture posed by models) And if they feel they do not belong, they often start to avoid school. Meanwhile, those who feel ugly or not good enough rarely join in class discussions, for fear of drawing attention to their appearance. Indeed, more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education, according to a survey by charity Ditch The Label. Even worse, almost one in three bullied children goes on to self-harm, with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves. Who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause? Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at Liverpool. 'Of course, it will be the job of, in particular, his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that. 'The only thing I will say is that he has two-and-a-half years left, he won't be going anywhere in the summer. That's for sure. 'They will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.' Liverpool boss Rodgers believes Sterling can fulfill his potential at Anfield over the next few years . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was also asked about Sterling in the post-match press conference, but preferred to focus on his side's fine display. Impressive goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half-time lead. Jordan Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit, but Olivier Giroud added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after Emre Can saw red. 'You always have imperfections in any game but I feel we started with a great intensity, which is what we wanted to put them under pressure,' Wenger said . 'We created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances. Liverpool are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . 'We had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half. 'In fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third. 'The second half was more down to, can we maintain the discipline, intensity and not allow them to come back early? We did that. 'We had many chances on the break that I've seen again but in the end it was 4-1 which is very convincing in a very important game.'

When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we’d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we’re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £200. They said: 'We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six .

I’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there’s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about £10,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I’ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for £100 each. But it’s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £40 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between £100 and £200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum’s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick — Andy Warhol’s muse — I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £20 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at £100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost £5 from a charity shop — I don’t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don’t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I’ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn’t fit in my kitchen so I’ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that’s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits.

The White House said Tuesday that Nye, who has degrees in engineering but was made famous by his 90s era television show for school children, 'Bill Nye the Science Guy,' would make the trek today on its behalf to shoot a video of the president. On the road trip from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the Florida swamp and back again, a 1,836 mile flight, Nye will have ample opportunity to take a big whiff of the carbon being emitted from the president's jet as it burns up more than 9,180 gallons of fuel.

Nye told press it was his first time on the president's private jet, but he once rode AF2 with former Vice President Al Gore. And, while he was working as an engineer at Boeing in 1978, Nye said he designed an anti-vibration tube for the horizontal stabilizer that is used in the company's 747 planes, and likely AF1. In a tweet last night, Nye said he was 'heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One with President Obama. 'We're going to '#ActonClimate,' he wrote. 'That said, the excitement, much like #climatechange, is real,' he added in a follow-up tweet a minute later. The statements were met with puzzled responses. 'Doesn't jet travel leave a big carbon footprint?' user Timothy Grome wrote. 'Hmm, seems ironic. doesn't seem very climate friendly earth day,' Allison B. of Galveston, Texas, said. White House communications director Jen Psaki got some 'cool points' today by posing for a selfie with Nye . Obama used the Earth Day trip to promote his administration's commitment to cutting carbon pollution and preserving Florida's wetlands, taking a tour of Everglades National Park and giving a speech that was first cancelled this morning for the public because of heavy showers, then rescheduled. 'I can’t think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation’s greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he’s looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly. The White House's official photographer, Pete Souza, posted this image to Instagram today with the following caption: 'It's @billnye (The Science Guy) on Marine One talking science on Earth Day with the President, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz' 'I can say as a general matter that the Department of Defense has acknowledged that climate change does pose a national security threat to the United States,' Earnest added. 'And there are a lot of practices that the Department of Defense has taken to try to reduce their carbon footprint.' Knoller, the unofficial historian of the modern White House, also frequently calculates how much fuel AF1 guzzles up – including during today's trip. Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott lit into Obama and Congress in anticipation of the president's visit. He accused them of not providing his state with what he believes to be appropriate financial resources to protect the Everglades . 'Our environment is too important to neglect and it’s time for the federal government to focus on real solutions and live up to their promises,' he said in a statement. Earnest mocked the GOP executive in comments to CBS DC and noted that Scott had 'outlawed employees in the State of Florida from even uttering the word \"climate change.\" ' 'It’s a little rich for someone who has made that declaration that somehow the president has not been sufficiently committed to defending the Everglades from the causes of climate change,' he said.", "reference_summary": "Engineer-turned-science-TV-host told a White House pool reporter that he loves the smell of jet fuel .

The dish loved by millions of British customers is to get a meat-free makeover that it is claimed will cut carbon emissions by half. The Swedish firm says producing the new version uses far less energy than making the pork and beef variety. Green scheme: IKEA claims it will 'save the planet' with its new vegetarian meatballs as far less energy is needed both to produce and cook them than the pork and beef variety . Its veggie balls will be rolled out this month, created from a secret recipe of chickpeas, peas, carrots, peppers, corn, kale and seasoning. Ikea is as famous for its meatballs as its cheap self-assembly furniture and UK customers often spend entire days inside its large warehouses eating and shopping. The company now sells a staggering one billion of its regular meatballs every year. In an interview with the Daily Mail, IKEA chief executive, Peter Agnefjall, said: ‘We are launching a vegetarian meatball. We see a big opportunity. The vegetarian meatball will go global in April and have 50pc less carbon dioxide than a normal meatball. It’s healthier and better for the planet.’ The firm has spent two years developing the veggieball, the first innovation to its meatball since it started selling food to encourage shoppers to stay inside its stores back in 1959. The vegetable-based snack is more environmentally friendly than the meat version, because cows and pigs are responsible for methane emissions. It also takes less energy to cook a veggieball. A spokesman said: ‘At IKEA we want to offer healthy food choices that are delicious, sustainable and affordable for the many, based on our Swedish identity. ‘We are currently developing our food range to provide options that meet the different preferences of our customers. ‘One of the exciting new products is a veggieball which will be launched in our stores from April onwards. ‘The veggie ball does not have any animal content in the ingredients. We will share more information about our new veggieballs nearer the time of the launch.’ Meatballs are one of Sweden’s national dishes and as iconic as Volvo cars or the pop group Abba. Meatballs and Malm beds: Ikea is as famous for its meatballs as its cheap self-assembly furniture and the company sells one billion of its regular meatballs every year . IKEA sells 5million meatballs in the UK annually and estimates it has sold 11.6billion in the UK since 1987. However a spokesman said last night the veggieball will not be available in the UK until May. Food contributed £1 billion to group sales last year. IKEA has 361 stores worldwide which all sell food – its meatball even has its own Facebook page. Meatballs are sold in Ikea’s restaurants for £3.80 and customer can also buy a frozen variety in its Swedish Food Market for £4.35 for 1kg. It has not yet revealed the cost of the veggieball. Ikea was caught up in the international food fraud scandal in 2013 when it emerged there was more than just beef and pork in its meatballs. Tests showed that there was also a significant amount of pony and horse. The business was started by billionaire Ingvar Kamprad, 88, who started selling matches in the 1920s. The IKEA name comes from his initials along with the name of the family farm Elmtaryd which was located in the local village of Agunnaryd. His third store in Stockholm was designed to be round so customers did not cut corners whilst walking around. The flat packed idea came while shipping a table by rail. It had been damaged in transit so the idea to separate the legs was hatched to protect it. Shipping it flat was also cheaper.", "reference_summary": "IKEA hopes to save the planet with chickpea and kale 'veggie balls' The 'non-meat meatball' also contains carrots, peppers and peas .

Although her wealth has increased year-on-year, her assets have been dwarfed by hundreds of financiers and businessmen. Britain’s super-rich are now more than twice as rich as they were in 2009, despite the catastrophic economic crisis. Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday. She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of £340m, compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first time . Len Blavatnick, pictured left with his wife Emily, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of £13.2bn. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja were pushed into second placed as their wealth was valued at £13bn . 1. Len Blavatnik £13.17billion (Investment, music and media) 2. Sri and Gopi Hinduja: £13billion (Industry and finance) 3. Galena and George Weston and family: £11billion (Retailing) 4. Alisher Usmanov: £9.8billion (Mining and investment) 5. David and Simon Reubeb: £9.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £547billion, up from £258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent. Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £100million – £45million more than in 2009 and £15million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years. The findings are revealed in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have ‘strong links’ to this country. The Queen’s wealth grew modestly in the last year by £10million to £340million, leaving her at number 302 – down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with £5.2billion. However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth. Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of £267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant. Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual Vacancy . George Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790 . Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industry . Among the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September. Worth an estimated £121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats. Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to £240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M. The footballer, 39, is now one of the country’s leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise £7million for needy children in the next three years. Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by £140million to £1.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine Jenkins . Len Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year’s Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £13.17billion. The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up £3.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles’ label, to his growing number of interests. The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984. Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik’s share was more than £4billion. Access’s stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow. Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a £41million mansion in London’s Kensington, recently paid $77million (£50.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated £75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government. Blavatnik’s ten quoted and private company stakes are worth £9billion. With £3billion of cash, £440million of property and other assets, he is worth £13.17billion. He may have just missed out on the top 100, but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year. The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his £1.04billion wealth. Lord Sugar, pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton, has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14 . He was described by The Sunday Times as ‘super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down’ on The Apprentice. The BBC show first ran in 2005, with winners including Leah Totton, who triumphed in 2013, securing Lord Sugar’s backing to open a cosmetic clinic. Lord Sugar has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14. There are now 117 sterling billionaires based in Britain, up 12 per cent on last year, but only 62 are British – including Sir Richard Branson, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir James Dyson. At the top of Britain’s cash pile is Ukraine-born Len Blavatnik, who has investments in music, industry and media, and is worth £13.17billion, up £3.17billion on 2014. A Briton on the average annual wage of £25,000 would need to work for 526,800 years to earn the same. At number two are India-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who have family interests in industry and global finance and are worth £13billion.

Despite the dramatic and rare event, the woman's injury was not detected straight away. Rather, her hairdresser noticed several days later that she had suffered minor burns on her scalp. Later that day the pensioner noticed her eye sight was blurred - she could barely see with her right eye. A few days later, she visited the opticians and was referred to see opthalmologist Mohit Gupta, who works at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, England. The 77-year-old woman was struck by lightning while she sat in her car. Days later, after her vision became blurred, a scan of her retina revealed she had a hole in her retina . Mr Gupta scanned the patient's retina, using a relatively new technique known as optical coherence tomography (OCT). The case report into the woman's treatment, published by the journal BMJ Case Reports, reveals Mr Gupta discovered a hole in the patient's macula, a part of the retina that is responsible for around 90 per cent of a person's vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist and colleague of Mr Gupta, said the woman's case reveals how important it is that medics check the vision of anyone struck by lightning. He told LiveScience: 'In the future, if patients are struck by lightning, it should be a routine process to refer them to an ophthalmologist to have an eye assessment.' He said the retina does not conduct electricity well, suggesting the injury was caused by the heat produced when the bolt struck. The woman was prescribed eye drops, but suffered an allergic reaction to them. She later underwent surgery to repair the hole in her macula, after two months of poor vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, said the heat from the lightning bolt is thought to have burned a hole in the woman's retina. It was eventually treated, via surgery . The operation involved removing the jelly part of the eye, which touches the retina, and injecting a gas bubble to push the layer at the back of the eye back together, Dr Dhillon said. He added his patient was 'quite fortunate in that only her retina was affected, and only in one eye'. Between 30 to 60 people each year are struck by lightning in the Uk. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the US sees an average of 51 people injured by lightning each year. Only around 10 per cent of those struck by a bolt are killed. Dr Dhillon said there have been reports of lightning strikes affecting other parts of the eyes, resulting in cataracts, burns or swelling.", "reference_summary": "Woman was struck by lightning in her car in Boston, Lincolnshire .
