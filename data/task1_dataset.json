As the Boston Marathon runners begin and, hopefully, finish their exhausting run Monday, the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways. More public safety officials throughout the route, a finish line area that prohibits large bags, National Guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security -- those are the most obvious, visible changes. And there are less obvious ones too. With the luxury of some time and healing, the city has moved on. And that is a blessing. In the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings, the manhunt, the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the Tsarnaev brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on. But we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness, the fog of war. Sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions. That narrative is just forming, and it's worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week. As a former homeland security adviser for Massachusetts, I was intimately involved with the marathon planning; as a commentator for CNN, I saw the story evolve during that week. Some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight, others by various after-action reports and assessments, and others by the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts. On Tuesday, the trial's sentencing phase will begin, determining whether he will receive the death penalty. In national security circles, there is often a debate about whether the U.S. judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials. Terrorism, the argument goes, is different from traditional crimes, and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats. Even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the Boston Marathon trial made clear that the system does work. What was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional. Prosecutors presented evidence. Defense attorneys challenged the witnesses. The defendant chose not to testify. A verdict was rendered. Its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases, but also took the mythology (maybe even the romanticism) of terrorism out of the case. It rendered Tsarnaev a common criminal. And that was a statement worth making. Recent reports about the shootout in Watertown that Friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt. It is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of Massachusetts Transit Police Officer Richard Donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure. Maybe it was adrenaline, maybe it was just the nature of the weapons. What is clear -- in Watertown and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now. That is a dangerous gap, and too many police departments are failing to address it. We have a notion of \"Boston Strong\" coming from the attacks and the city's response. I never loved the term, mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have Puritan stock and a kick-ass attitude. That is only partially true. We risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a \"keep calm\" persona. I have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response. The quick decisions to move runners off Boylston Street, the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so, the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers. It is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only. One part of the response that doesn't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks. Runners had no access to phones, and often had no identification. Family members of runners often didn't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route. First responders, in particular the Boston police and the Red Cross, focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to Commonwealth Avenue, a few blocks from the finish line. Once family members know that they are with loved ones, the trauma subsides. They often leave the scene, freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs. Crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster: Is my family OK? Obviously, there is so much more to learn. Could the bombing have been avoided? What would have happened if the FBI had shared information it had on the Tsarnaev family with local police? What if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers? It's \"woulda, coulda, shoulda\" but still essential. One of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isn't simply for blame, but to get better for the next time. Analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient. But do not believe that we are done learning. Looking back can be risky; it's often called the \"blinding clarity of hindsight\" because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror. But I have no doubt that at future anniversaries, what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written. And maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead.", "reference_summary": "Boston Marathon takes place Monday, two years after bombing, and sentencing phase of trial begins Tuesday .

In national security circles, there is often a debate about whether the U.S. judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials. Terrorism, the argument goes, is different from traditional crimes, and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats. Even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the Boston Marathon trial made clear that the system does work. What was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional. Prosecutors presented evidence. Defense attorneys challenged the witnesses. The defendant chose not to testify. A verdict was rendered. Its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases, but also took the mythology (maybe even the romanticism) of terrorism out of the case. It rendered Tsarnaev a common criminal. And that was a statement worth making. Recent reports about the shootout in Watertown that Friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt. It is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of Massachusetts Transit Police Officer Richard Donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure. Maybe it was adrenaline, maybe it was just the nature of the weapons. What is clear -- in Watertown and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now. That is a dangerous gap, and too many police departments are failing to address it. We have a notion of \"Boston Strong\" coming from the attacks and the city's response. I never loved the term, mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have Puritan stock and a kick-ass attitude. That is only partially true. We risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a \"keep calm\" persona. I have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response. The quick decisions to move runners off Boylston Street, the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so, the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers. It is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only. One part of the response that doesn't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks. Runners had no access to phones, and often had no identification. Family members of runners often didn't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route. First responders, in particular the Boston police and the Red Cross, focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to Commonwealth Avenue, a few blocks from the finish line. Once family members know that they are with loved ones, the trauma subsides. They often leave the scene, freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs. Crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster: Is my family OK? Obviously, there is so much more to learn. Could the bombing have been avoided? What would have happened if the FBI had shared information it had on the Tsarnaev family with local police? What if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers? It's \"woulda, coulda, shoulda\" but still essential. One of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons isn't simply for blame, but to get better for the next time. Analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient. But do not believe that we are done learning. Looking back can be risky; it's often called the \"blinding clarity of hindsight\" because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror. But I have no doubt that at future anniversaries, what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written. And maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead.", "reference_summary": "Boston Marathon takes place Monday, two years after bombing, and sentencing phase of trial begins Tuesday .

Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars. Before her sentence was handed down, Arias expressed remorse for her actions. \"To this day I can't believe that I was capable of doing something that terrible,\" Arias said. \"I'm truly disgusted and repulsed with myself. I'm horrified because of what I did, and I wish there was some way I could take it back.\" Earlier, Travis Alexander's sisters gave their victim impact statements. Hillary Alexander said she's trying to block her brother from her life. \"I don't want to remember him anymore, because it hurts too much to remember him alive. ... I remember how he was brutally taken from us and I can't handle it. This is what I've had to do so I can cope,\" she said through tears. Arias, 34, was found guilty of first-degree murder in May 2013. The jury that convicted her found the murder was especially cruel, making Arias eligible for the death penalty. However, that same jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision on whether she should live or die. A new jury was empanelled in October 2014 to decide Arias' fate, but they, too, were unable to reach a unanimous decision. Because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of Arias' case, the death penalty was taken off the table, leaving Arias' sentence up to the judge.

Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns. The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\" The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.", "reference_summary": "Were the police justified in stopping Freddie Gray?

Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns. The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\" The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.", "reference_summary": "Were the police justified in stopping Freddie Gray?

That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.", "reference_summary": "Were the police justified in stopping Freddie Gray?

Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia,\" reads one inscription. \"HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA. 150 Vermilyea Ave, New York City,\" another says. \"9th Batt Australians, G. Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July,\" reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced.

The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus \"low\" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. \"That said, human infections have occurred\" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. \"We are cautiously optimistic\" that it won't spread to humans, but \"we are prepared for the possibility,\" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called \"torticollis\" or \"stargazing\" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA.

Later that day the pensioner noticed her eye sight was blurred - she could barely see with her right eye. A few days later, she visited the opticians and was referred to see opthalmologist Mohit Gupta, who works at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, England. The 77-year-old woman was struck by lightning while she sat in her car. Days later, after her vision became blurred, a scan of her retina revealed she had a hole in her retina . Mr Gupta scanned the patient's retina, using a relatively new technique known as optical coherence tomography (OCT). The case report into the woman's treatment, published by the journal BMJ Case Reports, reveals Mr Gupta discovered a hole in the patient's macula, a part of the retina that is responsible for around 90 per cent of a person's vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist and colleague of Mr Gupta, said the woman's case reveals how important it is that medics check the vision of anyone struck by lightning. He told LiveScience: 'In the future, if patients are struck by lightning, it should be a routine process to refer them to an ophthalmologist to have an eye assessment.' He said the retina does not conduct electricity well, suggesting the injury was caused by the heat produced when the bolt struck. The woman was prescribed eye drops, but suffered an allergic reaction to them. She later underwent surgery to repair the hole in her macula, after two months of poor vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, said the heat from the lightning bolt is thought to have burned a hole in the woman's retina.

He told LiveScience: 'In the future, if patients are struck by lightning, it should be a routine process to refer them to an ophthalmologist to have an eye assessment.' He said the retina does not conduct electricity well, suggesting the injury was caused by the heat produced when the bolt struck. The woman was prescribed eye drops, but suffered an allergic reaction to them. She later underwent surgery to repair the hole in her macula, after two months of poor vision. Dr Permesh Dhillon, a medical internist at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, said the heat from the lightning bolt is thought to have burned a hole in the woman's retina. It was eventually treated, via surgery . The operation involved removing the jelly part of the eye, which touches the retina, and injecting a gas bubble to push the layer at the back of the eye back together, Dr Dhillon said. He added his patient was 'quite fortunate in that only her retina was affected, and only in one eye'. Between 30 to 60 people each year are struck by lightning in the Uk. Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the US sees an average of 51 people injured by lightning each year. Only around 10 per cent of those struck by a bolt are killed. Dr Dhillon said there have been reports of lightning strikes affecting other parts of the eyes, resulting in cataracts, burns or swelling.", "reference_summary": "Woman was struck by lightning in her car in Boston, Lincolnshire .

The man, known only as Xu, even tried to impregnate the 'daughter-in-law' himself after discovering his son had not slept with his wife a single time. Xu is currently under arrest for human trafficking by the police of Lianyungang city in eastern China, according to the People's Daily Online. Desperate for a grandchild, Xu (pictured) bought a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties . Xu and his son live outside Yancheng, a city of 1.6 million in eastern China. Hoping for a grandchild to carry on the bloodline, he spent 12,000 yuan (£1,311) purchasing a wife for his son, who has learning difficulties, through a middleman at the beginning of 2014. It's reported that the young bride, known only as Wang, is also mentally impaired. Six months after Wang 'married' into the family, Xu discovered that the young couple had not slept together at all. Desperate to have a 'grandson', Xu decided to have sex with her himself. After spending six months trying to get Wang pregnant, he realised that the young bride was likely to be infertile. The wife (pictured), known as Wang, was resold to another family after failing to get pregnant . Worrying that Wang, whose mental health was getting worse, might be a drain to the family without 'any concrete contribution', Xu sold her off to another family through a middleman in his village for 10,000 yuan (£1,093). The astonishing incident only emerged after a regular home visit by the community policemen at Guanyun County. The local policemen discovered the incident while paying a visit to the family who bought Wang from Xu . 'We asked her (Wang) name and age, but she couldn't answer,' said Gao Ming, a policeman at Guanyun County police station. This put Gao and his colleagues on alert and it took them two weeks to find out how Wang had been trafficked into the village.

However, as a shackled Durst appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom, the judge raged at his attorneys for being unprepared as they requested to delay the hearing. Durst was arrested on March 14 on charges of possession of a weapon by a felon and possession of a gun with a controlled substance, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, but has yet to be formally charged. It was the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durst. Authorities who searched the room, where Durst stayed under an alias, claim to have found over $42,000 in cash, a revolver, marijuana and a latex mask that could fit over his neck and head. FBI agents arrested Durst over fears he would flee the country, the agency has said. On Thursday, the judge eventually agreed to postpone the hearing until next week, when the witnesses - two FBI agents and a state trooper - could be charged with contempt of court for failing to appear. Long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in 1982 in New York, Durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in Texas in 2003. He is now facing the death penalty in California, where he is accused of murdering his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000. The real estate heir was temporarily placed on suicide watch soon after his arrest. His lawyers claim his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust the HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him in trial. Durst, who prosecutors have said is worth up to $100 million, has long been estranged from his powerful family, which has major New York real estate holdings. He has been held without bail at a facility for mentally ill inmates about 70 miles (110 km) from New Orleans, with local authorities having labeled him a suicide risk.", "reference_summary": "71-year-old tycoon used to live in Texas and went by name of Dorothy .

Scott Shirley, his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix, were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World, Orlando, when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew. After boarding the plane, the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet. Scroll down for video . Mayo Shirley, son Phoenix, and husband Scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a United Airlines flight . After putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin, the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . Mr Shirley told MailOnline Travel: 'My wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting. It was then, that she noticed her bag was wet. 'She then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet. When she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid, that's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit. 'Given my wife suffers from Mysophobia (phobia of germs), she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit. 'I immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that I too had had my hands all over this vomit. My wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind. 'I told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms.' The Shirley's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . Mr Shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area, and that staff had cleaned the area. 'It was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting, because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever,' he added. 'This was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks.' Mr Shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking, and they were given two options by United staff; fly out next day or remain in their seats. Because Mrs Shirley had to go to work next day at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats. The family were flying back on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Washington (file photo) However, staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area, and the passengers were given blankets, which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell. Mr Shirley said: 'The pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made. He told us we had to make a decision because he can't delay the other passengers. 'It was at this point I felt as if they couldn't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along. I told my wife that we should just take the next day flight. 'She said it isn't an option for her due to her position with the FDA and the nine days she had already been on holiday. Since we really had no choice in the matter, under duress of the situation, we agreed to the blanket option.' The family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in. 'It was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family,' added Mr Shirley. 'I felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us. This was the final straw for me. 'We went straight to United customer service who told us they can't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there. This was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there. No assistance was offered.' With their luggage still bagged up, Mr Shirley says United Airlines have offered them a $150 flight voucher each and some 'mileage points' A spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: The situation Mr Shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences, as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure. 'We offered them an alternate flight, but they decided to remain onboard. Our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate Mr Shirley and keep the flight on time.

Upon returning home, United has offered the each member of the family a $150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for Mrs Shirley. However, Mr Shirley said: 'I personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell.

Scott Shirley, his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix, were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World, Orlando, when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew. After boarding the plane, the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet. Scroll down for video . Mayo Shirley, son Phoenix, and husband Scott were forced to sit in seats surrounded by vomit on a United Airlines flight . After putting their luggage on the floor of the cabin, the family discovered the bags to be wet with vomit . Mr Shirley told MailOnline Travel: 'My wife decided to transfer her backpack with all our snacks in it to the spot where my son was sitting. It was then, that she noticed her bag was wet. 'She then rubbed the carpet area on the floor of our seats and discovered the whole area was wet. When she raised her had towards her face to smell the liquid, that's when she made the horrible discovery that the liquid was vomit. 'Given my wife suffers from Mysophobia (phobia of germs), she immediately had a look of panic on her face and loudly pronounced it to be vomit. 'I immediately had a feeling of being grossed out that I too had had my hands all over this vomit. My wife got up and ran towards the bathroom area of the plane with me following behind. 'I told the flight attendant what had happened and she directed us both to the available bathrooms.' The Shirley's luggage remains in the plastic rubbish sacks while they decide how to clean items . Mr Shirley says the family were told by cabin staff that a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area, and that staff had cleaned the area. 'It was clear that no one had cleaned the area where we were sitting, because there was no evidence of any chemical smell what so ever,' he added. 'This was purely that distinct smell of vomit on our hands and backpacks.' Mr Shirley described how his wife was so upset she began crying and shaking, and they were given two options by United staff; fly out next day or remain in their seats. Because Mrs Shirley had to go to work next day at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the family say they had no choice but to remain in the seats. The family were flying back on a United Airlines flight from Orlando to Washington (file photo) However, staff allegedly refused to clean and scrub down the affected area, and the passengers were given blankets, which they say did nothing to remove the pungent smell. Mr Shirley said: 'The pilot came out and asked if a resolution had been made. He told us we had to make a decision because he can't delay the other passengers. 'It was at this point I felt as if they couldn't care less about the disgusting situation they had put us in and only cared about moving the flight along. I told my wife that we should just take the next day flight. 'She said it isn't an option for her due to her position with the FDA and the nine days she had already been on holiday. Since we really had no choice in the matter, under duress of the situation, we agreed to the blanket option.' The family were given trash bags by the airline to put their luggage in. 'It was completely humiliating walking through the airport with our belongings in trash bags as if we were some sort of homeless family,' added Mr Shirley. 'I felt that we had to explain what happened to every person who stared awkwardly at us. This was the final straw for me. 'We went straight to United customer service who told us they can't do anything because it involves bags and we would have to go to baggage claim to speak with a supervisor there. This was on the other side of the airport which meant we had to now lug all this stuff there. No assistance was offered.' With their luggage still bagged up, Mr Shirley says United Airlines have offered them a $150 flight voucher each and some 'mileage points' A spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: The situation Mr Shirley described is certainly one that we wish no customer experiences, as our cleaners did not fully clean the seat area prior to departure. 'We offered them an alternate flight, but they decided to remain onboard. Our agents did the best they could in the short time they had to accommodate Mr Shirley and keep the flight on time. 'We’re reaching out to apologise for his experience.' The family were offered a $150 flight voucher, or the option to file a claim for the baggage, which they chose to do. Upon returning home, United has offered the each member of the family a $150 voucher as well as additional mileage points for Mrs Shirley. However, Mr Shirley said: 'I personally feel it is a slap in the face considering all we had to endure on this two hour flight from hell. 'I don't know what the lasting effects are going to be of this experience. We have to fly at least two more times later this year for weddings and I'm beginning to think the train might be an option. 'I felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were flying. All I could think about is what this vomit might have in it and if there was anything we would contact from it.'", "reference_summary": "Scott Shirley, his wife and son were returning from trip to Disneyland .

The Secretary of State's office says independent candidates must obtain 5,000 signatures from registered voters by August 11 to get their names on the general election ballot. Galbraith said he'll run on a similar platform, but will focus on his namesake. 'I mostly will be talking about the great Gatewood Galbraith,' he said.

Michael Keith Spell, 25, of Parachute, Colorado, was sentenced following a hearing before state District Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney. Spell pleaded guilty in October to killing Sherry Arnold, 43, after attempting to abduct the popular math teacher as she was jogging near her home in 2012. Arnold's body was found months later buried in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack \"brought the devil out in him\" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December. He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston.

Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family.

Co-defendant Lester Van Waters Jr. was sentenced in December to 80 years in prison on a charge of deliberate homicide by accountability. Sentenced to die behind bars: Michael Keith Spell, 25, sits in state District Court in Sidney, Mont, Friday April 17, 2015, before being sentenced to 100 years prison for the 2012 murder of a 43-year-old teacher in the booming Bakken oil patch of Montana . Murdered at random: Sherry Arnold, a popular maths teacher from the small town of Sidney, Montana, was on a morning jog on January 7 when she disappeared. She was pulled into a car by Spell and his friend, strangled to death, and then buried 50 miles away in North Dakota . Defense attorneys had asked that Spell be placed into custody of state health officials for placement in an institution for the mentally disabled. They claimed he was 'easily confused and displays the intelligence of an 11-year-old'. They said Spell's mental problems made him unable to conform to the law, making him eligible for commitment to the Montana Department of Health and Human Services. In the days before Arnold's killing, Spell and Waters traveled to Sidney from Colorado, using crack cocaine throughout their journey, according to authorities and the men's previous testimony. The defendants came to the region looking for work in the booming Bakken oil patch. During their trip, Waters allegedly told Spell that using crack \"brought the devil out in him\" and began talking about kidnapping and killing a woman, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors. Spell's attorneys alleged Waters threatened to kill Spell with a utility razor unless he went along with the kidnapping plan. After the pair spotted Arnold along a Sidney street, Spell tried to grab her, leading to a struggle in which Arnold was choked or otherwise asphyxiated, authorities said. Co-accused: Lester Van Waters (left) was sentenced to 80 years in December. He and Spell (right-in 2012) were under the influence of crack cocaine when they kidnapped and murder Mrs Arnold . Killed: Michael Spell told investigators he pulled Sherry Arnold into a car and Waters choked her to death by before they buried her in a shallow grave on a farmstead near Williston . Spell said during an October change-of-plea hearing that he was unsure if he or Waters had killed Arnold. Arnold's body was found months after her disappearance in a shallow grave in a rural area near Williston, North Dakota. For Sidney residents, Arnold's death offered a horrifying illustration of the social upheaval caused by an energy boom that has turned the once-sleepy town into an oil patch hub. Crime has spiked in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota over the past several years as traffickers of methamphetamine and other drugs seek to profit off oil workers flush with cash, according to law enforcement officials. Spell was spared a potential death sentence after state health officials agreed with the defense that he was mentally disabled. Guilty: In this February 2012 photo, Michael Keith Spell, appears at a hearing in the Williams County Courthouse in Williston. Defense attorneys wanted Spell sentenced to an institution for the mentally disabled . Dearly missed: Rhonda Whited-Rupp holds a picture of her sister, Sherry Arnold, seen in a cowboy hat, and Arnold's family. Michael Keith Spell was sentenced to 100 years prison Friday for the murder of Mrs Arnold . But Simonton in May rejected arguments from the defense that Spell's history of low IQ scores, his difficulty reading and other mental problems rendered him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors recommended 100 years in prison and thus became Spell's sentence Friday. Defense attorneys Al Avignone and Lisa Banick said Friday's judgment will be appealed based on their continued belief that he was not fit for trial.

The part-time actor was going through customs to board his EasyJet flight, when airport staff discovered he had six £1.80 tubs of the traditional pudding and North East delicacy in his hand luggage. The boiled-legume dish was removed from his bags, along with several Greggs pies. Pease pudding is a traditional dish made with split peas and a favourite in the North East of England . The 58-year-old, who previously appeared in the BBC TV series Blackadder, was surprised at the mix-up. 'I love my pease pudding,' he told The Mirror. 'I think the resemblance to Semtex was pushing it a bit far as it was in containers marked pease pudding.' Security staff told the traveller his pease pudding could 'technically' be classed as Semtex . However, the traveller did admit he was carrying six tubs of the pudding along with pies from the Greggs bakery - which became synonymous with the 'pasty tax' introduced and then scrapped by Chancellor George Osborne in 2012. After being told that the consistency of the pudding could see it 'technically' classed as Semtex, he reportedly offered to let security taste the delicacy to prove it wasn't. Luckily for the pease-lover, who lives in Sussex, he was allowed through with his snacks and was simply warned to pack them in hold luggage the next time he was travelling. The traveller has also placed several Greggs pies in his hand luggage for the journey . An customs spokeswoman said: 'There is no customs policy with regard to pease pudding so far as I am aware.' When MailOnline contacted a Newcastle Airport spokeswoman, she said they do not comment on security matters. It is not the first time unusual items have been picked up by airport security scanners. Stansted Airport has previously confiscated items including furry handcuffs, while two Italian women were stopped at Munich Airport, in Germany for trying to transport a human skeleton belonging to a dead relative. Last year, customs officers at Birmingham Airport seized a giant squash from a passenger who was trying to smuggle it into Britain from Asia. The 4ft-long vegetable, which weighed in more than at 4st, was found with 175lb (79kg) of fish and 94,000 cigarettes from Bangladesh. A spokesman for Solihull Council said: 'It is a bit of a rare find, as you can imagine we do get cigarettes a lot, but not a squash, especially not one of this size.' America's TSA (Transport Security Administration) even has an Instagram account where it documents the weird wonder, and sometimes downright dangerous, items confiscated at security.", "reference_summary": "The Geordie passenger was pulled aside at customs by security .

Kevin Bollaert, 28, was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. One victim said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.'

Kevin Bollaert, 28, was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. One victim said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.'

Missing his wife who had recently passed away from cancer, a desperate Ted Koran, 59, phoned the Veterans Suicide Hotline but all he got was a recorded message. Ted said he was put on hold three times for 10 minutes at a time and the only reason he decided not to kill himself on Saturday was to care for the 60 rescue animals he and his wife had looked after together. Scroll down for video . Depression: Ted Koran says that he came very close to ending his own life when he failed to get through to a counselor on the VA Suicide Hotline on Saturday . 'My wife and I saved them, and they saved me,' Ted Koran said to ABC Action News from his home in Florida. Ted Koran's experience highlights the increasing problems the VA is facing with its Veterans Crisis Hotline as it fights depression among ex-servicemen. First set up in 2007, the service had 60 calls a day on four manned phone lines. Today it has 52 operators fielding up to 1,000 phone calls a day, but the service is at breaking point. Despite statistics which say 22 veterans end their lives every day across the US, depressed former soldiers are still being put on hold by helplines. Sadness: Ted (right in his Air Force uniform) said he was thinking suicidal thoughts because he was struggling to deal with the loss of his wife Karen, (left with Ted) who passed away six months ago . Anguish: Ted said that he has battled with severe depression since his wife (Karen, right) passed away and wanted someone to talk to on Saturday night . Love: The Koran's ran The Critter Place out of Weeki Wachee in Florida and only the thought of the 60 animals he and Karen (pictured) cared for stopped Ted from ending his own life on Saturday . Help: The loss of Karen (pictured) was devastating to Ted. The Veterans Association estimates that 22 former servicemen and women end their lives daily - a figure that could be reduced they claim if they got more funding for their helpline service. On Saturday, Ted admitted to suffering an emotional breakdown. 'I was missing my wife Karen,' he said to ABC Action News. Ted's wife passed away from cancer six months ago and he says he needed help. 'I went to the only place that I knew and that I had available to me, the VA,' said Ted. The first call for help Ted made to the James Haley VA Center in Tampa ended in a recorded message giving him the 800 number hotline. He claims he was then put on hold for 10 minutes. 'I had to sit there patiently, in emotional distress, in tears, wanting to give up, desperately needing someone to talk to,' said Ted to ABC Action News. Much loved: Ted has assured his friends and family that he will get through the death of this wife (pictured) and has asked them not to worry . Frustrated, Ted said he hung up and redialled two more times. 'They had me on the verge of saying to hell with it,' he said. Damningly, Ted claims that when he finally got hold of a counselor, they were of little help. A Scripps national investigation also found shocking instances of suicidal vets unable to get through to speak to a counselor. One veteran claims he was on hold for 36 minutes. 'The very ones that are supposed to be there for me let me down,' said Ted. However, following national attention, Ted claims he was phoned by the VA who wanted to speak to him. Ted took to Facebook on Tuesday and wrote that the two phone calls he had with the VA were a mixed bag. 'Had two calls from the VA. One from a social worker at the James Haley Tampa VA. Another from the VA crisis hotline headquarters,' wrote Ted to Facebook. 'The first hour long conversation didn't go so well. He ended up getting upset at me because by the end I felt that he was just doing his job and I didn't feel any compassion in that he only called me because his superior told him to contact me. 'He was the very reason I was reluctant to seek 'professional' help for so long. 'The VA Crisis hotline call went totally different. By the end of that hour long conversation I wish I could have given her a hug.' For confidential support in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255.

Ted said he was put on hold three times for 10 minutes at a time and the only reason he decided not to kill himself on Saturday was to care for the 60 rescue animals he and his wife had looked after together. Scroll down for video . Depression: Ted Koran says that he came very close to ending his own life when he failed to get through to a counselor on the VA Suicide Hotline on Saturday . 'My wife and I saved them, and they saved me,' Ted Koran said to ABC Action News from his home in Florida. Ted Koran's experience highlights the increasing problems the VA is facing with its Veterans Crisis Hotline as it fights depression among ex-servicemen. First set up in 2007, the service had 60 calls a day on four manned phone lines. Today it has 52 operators fielding up to 1,000 phone calls a day, but the service is at breaking point. Despite statistics which say 22 veterans end their lives every day across the US, depressed former soldiers are still being put on hold by helplines. Sadness: Ted (right in his Air Force uniform) said he was thinking suicidal thoughts because he was struggling to deal with the loss of his wife Karen, (left with Ted) who passed away six months ago . Anguish: Ted said that he has battled with severe depression since his wife (Karen, right) passed away and wanted someone to talk to on Saturday night . Love: The Koran's ran The Critter Place out of Weeki Wachee in Florida and only the thought of the 60 animals he and Karen (pictured) cared for stopped Ted from ending his own life on Saturday . Help: The loss of Karen (pictured) was devastating to Ted. The Veterans Association estimates that 22 former servicemen and women end their lives daily - a figure that could be reduced they claim if they got more funding for their helpline service. On Saturday, Ted admitted to suffering an emotional breakdown. 'I was missing my wife Karen,' he said to ABC Action News. Ted's wife passed away from cancer six months ago and he says he needed help. 'I went to the only place that I knew and that I had available to me, the VA,' said Ted. The first call for help Ted made to the James Haley VA Center in Tampa ended in a recorded message giving him the 800 number hotline. He claims he was then put on hold for 10 minutes. 'I had to sit there patiently, in emotional distress, in tears, wanting to give up, desperately needing someone to talk to,' said Ted to ABC Action News. Much loved: Ted has assured his friends and family that he will get through the death of this wife (pictured) and has asked them not to worry . Frustrated, Ted said he hung up and redialled two more times. 'They had me on the verge of saying to hell with it,' he said. Damningly, Ted claims that when he finally got hold of a counselor, they were of little help. A Scripps national investigation also found shocking instances of suicidal vets unable to get through to speak to a counselor. One veteran claims he was on hold for 36 minutes. 'The very ones that are supposed to be there for me let me down,' said Ted. However, following national attention, Ted claims he was phoned by the VA who wanted to speak to him. Ted took to Facebook on Tuesday and wrote that the two phone calls he had with the VA were a mixed bag. 'Had two calls from the VA. One from a social worker at the James Haley Tampa VA. Another from the VA crisis hotline headquarters,' wrote Ted to Facebook. 'The first hour long conversation didn't go so well. He ended up getting upset at me because by the end I felt that he was just doing his job and I didn't feel any compassion in that he only called me because his superior told him to contact me.

Speaking at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Friday night, Justice Diana Bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment. She said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia, hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas. Scroll down for video . A top judge in Brisbane has said that surrogacy laws need to be overhauled to prevent a repeat of the baby Gammy (pictured with his mother) case . 'I personally think we should regulate and allow commercial surrogacy in Australia,' she said. 'If we allow it in Australia, we then can regulate it and ensure that it's done on ethical terms.' Her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases, where parents have refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals. This week an Australian couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their Indian surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins. Documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Justice Diana Bryant (pictured) has spoken out about Australia's surrogacy laws . The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. They was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. The Indian case is similar to the controversial baby Gammy scenario. Gammy was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother, however after reportedly learning that he had a disability, his Australian parents, West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell, only brought his twin sister home with them. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. Following these cases the Thai government passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services.

Ms King shocked and intrigued the Australian public when she entered into a relationship with Thompson, who was twice her age, while he was also involved with Leona – who is nicknamed Le. The 60-year-old’s first meeting with Thompson was when she was 15 years old Sydney school girl, and has now revealed the salacious details of their 15-year affair and unconventional arrangement. Scroll down for video . Bunkie King, 60, has revealed how her three-way relationship with Australian actor Jack Thompson and her sister worked . Ms King, also appeared with Thompson in 1975 movie Scobie Malone, had a 15-year affair with the womanising actor . Speaking with A Current Affair about her book, Somebody I Used to Know: Love, Loss and Jack Thompson, Ms King said she decided to pen a novel during an argument with her son. At one point, he shouted: 'I'm not proud that my mother had sex with her sister.' This was the moment Ms King realised there were many misconceptions about her relationship with the womanising actor. 'That really shocked me because that wasn't our relationship,' she said. 'It never entered my head [that's what people thought], so I put it down warts and all.' Ms King, who has two children with her ex-husband, also revealed how she shared one man with her sister, 20. A young Bunkie King pictured here with her sister Leona - nicknamed Le - and Jack Thompson . Le (pictured left) was 20 years old when she started a relationship with the Australian actor . Jack pictured in 1980 (left) and 2013 (right), was written about under the headline 'Jack and his Jills', when he told a newspaper he felt 'like a bone being fought over by two dogs' But from the start the siblings made it clear they were not going to sleep with him in the same bed. When Ms King first moved in with Le and Thompson she was 'allocated one night a week' with the actor. But then they relocated to Collaroy - on Sydney's North Shore - and the sisters would see him on alternating nights. Ms King said she had never close to Le and there were times where she felt her sister, who she is now estranged from, wished she had Thompson all to herself. But it was all or nothing with Thompson, who starred in Spyforce - an action series following Australian Military Intelligence operatives in the South West Pacific during World War II. 'I was happy for whatever crumbs came off the table. It did cause problems with jealousy and things like that. I don't think either of us would have chosen it that way,' Ms King said. Cleo magazine featured him reclined naked on a sofa catapulting him to sex symbol status overnight . Talking to New Idea, Ms King said their relationship in many ways was 'quite old-fashioned'. 'We had separate bedrooms. He was just sleeping with both of us,' she said. In her interview with ACA, Ms King said her relationship was not a 'unique situation'. 'It is in western society but it's not a unique situation for a man to have more than one wife,' she said. 'In western society, a man generally speaking has a wife and a mistress or maybe a couple of mistresses.' But despite his commitment to two women, Ms King claims Thompson still had time to be unfaithful to her and Le. She said what hurt her the most about his alleged infidelities was the fact he was not open, honest and upfront about it. Ms King also revealed her sister did not know about her regular afternoon visits from Thompson at their mother's house when he started to court her. The visits in the 1970s increased to three a week and, after months of spending time together, she fell hopelessly in love knowing he was with Le. Ms King has revealed in her memoirs how, as a virgin, she struggled to dampen her feelings for the blond tanned hunk and desperately craved his love even after her sister caught them kissing.

He's obviously Le's boyfriend and I feel bad for her, but I don't know how to give him up.' It was the same for Jack too and, with his popularity at its height in the mid-1970s, the Wake In Fright star bought a rambling farm in the hills above Coffs Harbour, on the NSW mid-north coast, and convinced the sisters to share an 'open' and 'honest' relationship with him.

In her book, the 60-year-old also speaks frankly about her drug use, ranging from marijuana to acid to heroin. But she did not classify her drug use as 'hardcore'. 'Hardcore to me is someone who is basically mainlining. It was the 60s and the 70s,' Ms King said.

After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode.

MailOnline also found a charred passport of a Malaysian mother killed in the horror. Relatives of Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, whose husband and son were also killed, called for urgent action to clear the site, return items to bereaved families and bring those responsible for the carnage to justice.

Many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - were visible among MH17's burned remains. Investigators say they were prevented from working properly in the locations where MH17 hit the ground due to fierce fighting between pro-Moscow rebels and Ukrainian military forces. The new finds of human remains were collected this week by the Dutch - working with Malaysian, Australian and Ukrainian colleagues - at a site previously inaccessible to the investigators, it was revealed. Head of the Dutch recovery mission Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said: 'More remains have been found in both parts of the so-called \"burn sites.\"' Jean Fransman, spokesman for the Dutch Department of Justice, added: 'The mission was again able to recover human remains and personal effects at two sites.'

The latest search operation had resumed yesterday after being halted for winter, and centred around the Petropavlivka, some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) west of Grabove and Granovo where most of the debris fell.

The probe team is due to issue its report into the crash later this year. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode. 'Probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a BUK missile, but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter.' The dead from MH17 comprised 192 Dutch citizens (one also had U.S. citizenship), 44 Malaysians, including the 15 crew members, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, ten Britons (one also had South African citizenship), four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander.", "reference_summary": "Investigators have found more body parts from where MH17 fell in Ukraine .

Chilling: MailOnline's photographer spotted the burned and torn passport of loving wife and mother Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, one of the 298 slaughtered when MH17 was downed over Ukraine on July 17, 2014. Her family in Kuala Lumpur has given MailOnline permission to publish the picture . The investigators searched for body parts and debris at a location that was previously considered unsafe . The finds came several days after MailOnline revealed how possibly key evidence and personal possessions were left lying in fields so long after a crash which shocked the world. MailOnline also found a charred passport of a Malaysian mother killed in the horror. Relatives of Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, whose husband and son were also killed, called for urgent action to clear the site, return items to bereaved families and bring those responsible for the carnage to justice. 'It broke my heart to see the picture, her passport still in the debris of the plane,' said her brother Clement, 47, in Kuala Lumpur. 'But thank you so much for finding it and telling us about it.' Also spotted at the site by MailOnline were a bracelet made of beads, a pair of sunglasses, ripped clothing and random pages from guidebooks in a reminder that many of the murdered passengers were heading to Kuala Lumpur on holiday. Investigators have renewed their search for body parts and debris in eastern Ukraine this week . A vehicle carries away debris from the site of the plane crash near the village of Grabove, in self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic . Many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - were visible among MH17's burned remains. Investigators say they were prevented from working properly in the locations where MH17 hit the ground due to fierce fighting between pro-Moscow rebels and Ukrainian military forces. The new finds of human remains were collected this week by the Dutch - working with Malaysian, Australian and Ukrainian colleagues - at a site previously inaccessible to the investigators, it was revealed. Head of the Dutch recovery mission Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said: 'More remains have been found in both parts of the so-called \"burn sites.\"' Jean Fransman, spokesman for the Dutch Department of Justice, added: 'The mission was again able to recover human remains and personal effects at two sites.' A statement said that 'personal effects were given to the members of the mission by the local population - it was jewellery'. An investigator wheels away parts of debris from the site of the plane crash in eastern Ukraine . Grim: Alongside Mabel's passport, many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - are visible among MH17's charred detritus . Haunting: Personal belongings of victims are still littered around the field - and possibly crucial evidence -because the crash scene hasn't been cleared nine months after the Malaysian Airways flight came down . A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash . The latest search operation had resumed yesterday after being halted for winter, and centred around the Petropavlivka, some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) west of Grabove and Granovo where most of the debris fell. A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash. Officials of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic were also at the site during the search which will last several weeks subject to a ceasefire holding in the region. 'A group of Dutch and Malaysian experts is working in the DPR,' said Aleksey Kostrubitskiy, local emergencies minister. 'Today 10 per cent of the area - two places where fragments had fallen and there was fire - was worked over. 'Sixteen containers of fragments have been loaded. 'Units of the [DPR] emergencies ministry will go there every day and 10 staffers of the emergencies ministry will be involved.' The Dutch-led team was forced to leave the crash site in August amid shooting close to the crash site. Souvenir: A shot glass bought as a reminder of what should have been a jovial trip lies on the ground . A sign indicating the entrance to the site in eastern Ukraine is forbidden is displayed as Dutch and Malaysian investigators search for debris . The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands . A week long recovery operation in November was delayed by fighting between separatists and Ukrainian troops. Representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have also faced acute problems accessing the crash site to secure key evidence. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site. The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands. Forensic experts in the Dutch city of Hilversum have identified bodies of 296 victims of the crash. Two victims - both from the Netherlands - remain unidentified. The probe team is due to issue its report into the crash later this year. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode. 'Probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a BUK missile, but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter.' The dead from MH17 comprised 192 Dutch citizens (one also had U.S. citizenship), 44 Malaysians, including the 15 crew members, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, ten Britons (one also had South African citizenship), four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander.", "reference_summary": "Investigators have found more body parts from where MH17 fell in Ukraine .

Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.'

Months before Binh's transplant, Michael Wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister Phuoc (right) to receive part of his liver . Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months.

Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

Vietnamese Binh Wagner, 3, and her identical twin Phuoc were left with fatally impaired liver function due to Alagille syndrome. But when Phuoc needed a donor just a little more, their adopted father Michael chose her to receive his liver, which was a perfect match. Now, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, Binh and her sister Phuoc are both on their road to recovery, reports the National Post. Scroll down for video . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!!': A 3-year-old girl in Ontario recently received a donated liver after her sicker twin sister was chosen ahead of her to receive part of their adopted father's liver early this year . Binh and Phuoc Wagner of Kingston, Ontario were adopted by Michael and Johanne Wagner around a year and a half ago from Vietnam. The twins suffer from Alagille syndrome, a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!! There are not enough words to thank the amazing and so unselfish donor,' the parents wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to the girls. The post continued: . 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago. 'We are looking forward to all being reunited and leading a healthier life now, with both transplants finally behind us.' When Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant, they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match. However, Wagner was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters, leaving him with an impossible choice. In the end, doctors suggested giving the donation to daughter Phuoc, since she needed it the most. Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and it has so far been a success. Anonymous lifesaver: The parents have asked that media not try to track down the donor of Binh's new liver, because he or she has chosen to remain anonymous . Recovering well: 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago,' read a Facebook update about the girl . Five days after the operation, the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Months before Binh's transplant, Michael Wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister Phuoc (right) to receive part of his liver . Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings.

Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch.

Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century.

But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George’s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany’s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left. People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. SCOUSERS . People from Liverpool are often called ‘Scousers’. The name is short for ‘Lobscouse’, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port.

In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down.

Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down (picture posed by models) And if they feel they do not belong, they often start to avoid school. Meanwhile, those who feel ugly or not good enough rarely join in class discussions, for fear of drawing attention to their appearance. Indeed, more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education, according to a survey by charity Ditch The Label. Even worse, almost one in three bullied children goes on to self-harm, with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves. Who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause? Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

Indeed, more than six out of ten children who have been bullied said it had a detrimental effect on their education, according to a survey by charity Ditch The Label. Even worse, almost one in three bullied children goes on to self-harm, with 10 per cent attempting to kill themselves. Who knows what nightmares this new type of bullying will cause? Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it.

Living up to these ideals of beauty is one of many pressures bearing down on 15-year-old Alannya Blackmore as she prepares to take her GSCEs this summer. Alannya, who lives near Yeovil, Somerset, has been on the receiving end of some of the judgments passed down in the 50 or so videos made by fellow pupils at her school, an oversubscribed academy rated ‘good with outstanding features’ by Ofsted. Although she has been mainly rated ‘hot’, she has also been dismissed as ‘not’ in some clips. When she describes her experiences, it offers a glimpse into a brutal world in which youngsters’ popularity is dictated by looks and the ‘in’ girls seek to maintain their classroom pecking order by passing down decrees on others. As girls grow up, the prettiest rise to the top of the popularity poll, and it is this group, says Alannya, who are more likely to feel entitled to declare from up high who also makes the grade. She says: ‘If you are judged to be “not”, you don’t say anything as you don’t want the others to think you are upset. But it’s humiliating because it’s so public. Some people will try to change the way they look because of it. There are loads of these videos. There are so many of them on people’s Facebook pages as well as YouTube — and there’s nothing adults can do.’ ‘Hot or not’ started off as an American phenomenon, where young women would put a picture of themselves online and be rated by other users. In the UK, it morphed into the version we have today. Some youngsters justify these videos by saying classmates can put themselves forward to be rated by ‘liking’ a status announcement saying someone at their school is planning to film one. Sadly, it’s often the most insecure youngsters, aching to be accepted by the pretty girls who make these videos, who volunteer. They’re seeking validation they won’t get. So why is such ruthlessness starting ever younger? One reason is puberty is kicking in earlier, with as many as one in seven girls showing signs of breast development (with the associated surges in hormones) aged just eight. Girls can also be allowed by their parents to grow up too soon, so they act like teenagers without the maturity to understand the consequences of their actions. In a world where girls grow up feeling like they are in a constant beauty contest — half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, and a fifth of those under 11 have already been on a diet — these ‘hot-or-not’ videos should hardly surprise us. And middle-class girls are most likely to post these videos, as their families more often own iPads and computers. Middle-class values also make them more likely to want to look a certain way and avoid conflict, says Rachel Simmons, author of best-selling book Odd Girl Out. That also means any anger and aggression comes out in indirect ways — such as those brutal video judgments. What is so shocking is their total disregard for others’ feelings. But in an age where children spend longer in front of a screen than with friends, one result is that they’re not learning social skills or empathy. Indeed, they may be genuinely unaware of the impact. Throw into the mix that they see adults being just as judgmental on some of our most popular TV shows — The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, The Apprentice — and it’s easy to see where they get the idea that being nasty wins friends. ‘You are showing children that it’s entertaining to you — that normalises it,’ says Rosalind Wiseman, author of self-help book Queen Bees And Wannabes. But there may be a glimmer of hope. In a clip in another bedroom, Sophie, yet another girl in her early teens, signs off her YouTube video — which was viewed 13,000 times — saying: ‘If it offends anyone, I am not sorry. I don’t care because I am just telling the truth.’ The comments posted by viewers make clear that some of her peers see life very differently. ‘Everyone is beautiful in their own way. What is the point of doing these videos?’ asks one. ‘I can only hope that one day, you’ll understand what a terrible thing this is to do,’ adds another. Let’s hope parents can help that message spread before too many young lives are damaged. Some names have been changed.

In a pink-walled bedroom, decorated with posters of Justin Bieber, best friends Zoe and Eleanor settle themselves on to the bed and press play on the webcam of their computer. But they’re not about to video-chat with friends or a relative abroad. What they’re doing is far more pernicious — and will be horrifying to parents everywhere. Scroll down for video . In a world where girls grow up fast, should these online hot or not videos really surprise us? Half of three to six-year-olds say they worry about being fat, with a fifth of girls under 11 confessing to have even tried diets (picture posed by model) ‘This is mine and Eleanor’s hot-or-not video,’ announces Zoe, waving a list of her classmates’ names at the camera. Then she settles down — seemingly without any comprehension of the genie she is unleashing from its bottle — to publicly deem each one of them as either ‘hot’ or ‘not’. It’s hard to think of a more spiteful game. ‘If we say you are not pretty or good looking, don’t get offended,’ pipes up Eleanor, issuing the standard disclaimer for videos of this kind. ‘It’s just our opinion!’ The roll-call then begins. ‘Anna Wright’ is the first of the 30 names on the list to be read out as if from a class register. ‘Hot!’ the girls immediately exclaim in unison. Next is Charlotte Davies. ‘Hot!’ is the decree. The name of a third classmate, however, is met with a pause just long enough for the girls to exchange knowing smirks. ‘Not hot. Sorry!’ they chime in high voices which belie the cruelty of what they’re saying. Remember, these girls, and the objects of their derision, are no more than ten or 11. And they’re far from alone. I’ve discovered that these kinds of scenes are being played out in children’s bedrooms across the country. Seven more classmates, both boys and girls, get the thumbs-down. As soon as the last judgment is handed down, the girls sign off with a satisfied: ‘Thanks for watching!’ They then upload the video to YouTube for everyone to see. In just a few days, the clip gets 120 views, suggesting no one in their class — or perhaps their school — has missed it. But what people will miss is the sight of the stricken faces of the children so cruelly dismissed, the tears shed into pillows, and the bravery needed to go to school the next day. Of course, cruelty among children has existed since the words ‘No, you can’t play with us’ were first uttered. But this is a new, more public humiliation. Scroll through YouTube and you’ll find ‘hot-or-not’ videos by girls who look no older than nine. Thousands more can be found on Facebook pages. These all seem to be filmed in bedrooms and verdicts delivered with a brutal certainty even Katie Hopkins would baulk at. There are variations — one angelic-looking little girl called Brianna used ‘Perfect’ or ‘Not Perfect’. She’s had 2,000 views so far. As a parenting expert who’s written five books on raising children, I know the effect this could have on those deemed ‘not hot’. And coming at such a critical time in their lives, when youngsters are looking to their peers to help them work out who they are, those effects can be life-long. The fact ‘hot-or-not’ videos are so public increases a young person’s feelings of shame and powerlessness about how they look. My worry is that youngsters internalise these labels and start bullying themselves, telling themselves they are ugly and they can do nothing about it. Feeling unattractive and worthless can have a devastating impact on their chances of success: study after study has found that the grades of such children go down.

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it’s a lot of work and it’s also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need - it’s entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children’s diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they’re young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they’re young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they’re not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and they don’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they’re running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that’s really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don’t know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. ‘I’m not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I’m not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it’s okay as well as long as it’s a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There’s sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book, 'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients, has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'", "reference_summary": "UK celebrity cook book author Annabel Karmel shares her thoughts on paleo for kids .

'The baby won't have any nutrition they need - it’s entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children’s diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they’re young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they’re young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they’re not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and they don’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they’re running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that’s really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don’t know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. ‘I’m not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I’m not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it’s okay as well as long as it’s a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There’s sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat. Mum to the rescue: Karmel aims to revolutionise meal time for mums with 33 freezer friendly meals in range . It was while she worked at a playgroup that her success in fact began. Sharing recipes with other mums, they praised her meals and suggested she write a cook book. And the rest is history. Her cook book, 'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients, has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'", "reference_summary": "UK celebrity cook book author Annabel Karmel shares her thoughts on paleo for kids .

Her cook book, 'The Complete Baby And Toddler Meal Planner' (in which she worked closely with the Institute of Children's Health) was born. And despite initially being rejected by 20 publishers, it went on to sell four million copies back in 1991, making her a guru of children's cookery. Rags to riches: Karmel's first cook book 'Complete Baby and Toddler Meal Planner' was refused by 20 publishers before getting picked up . Now in a bid to help the seven million obese people currently across the nation, Karmel has arrived in Australia to promote her new healthy food range for children in the hopes to be a trail blazer, revolutionise the healthy meal scene for children and help mother's for generations to come. 1.Spaghetti bolognese - 'I add five hidden vegetables - onion, leek, tomato, carrot and capsicum. It's absolutely delicious.' 2.Chicken and apple balls - ' With minced chicken, thyme, breadcrumbs, apple, chicken stock mixed and made into little balls.' 3. Fish goujons - 'Fish coated in crushed rice crispies and parmesan. It's different but really yummy and children lick them up with their fingers.' The freezer friendly meal range is made in Australia with locally sourced ingredients, has over 33 meal options and includes a variety of flavours from butter chicken to oriental food and a five veg spaghetti bolognese. 'Somebody has to do something, children are getting mature onset diabetes and they’re loosing their teeth with all the huge amounts of sugar,' she says. 'Plus fat children are not happy children, they are not good at sports, they are laughed at, they have complexes and you know you want them to grow up to be healthy and happy.' She also adds, while mums want the best for their children, it is difficult feeding children and they need help because currently whenever they buy something unhealthy food is pushed at them. 'The only challenge now will be to get mums to go to the frozen food aisle and buy these foods because its not where they expect to find them.'", "reference_summary": "UK celebrity cook book author Annabel Karmel shares her thoughts on paleo for kids .

In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, UK children's cookbook guru Annabel Karmel has slammed Pete Evans' controversial bone broth recipe in his book 'Bubba Yum Yum - The Paleo Way', calling it dangerous, and said the paleo method goes against everything nutritionists and child health experts recommend. 'Babies need milk - it needs to be a formula or breast milk because it has the nutrients they need and bone broth will not give them what breast milk or formula does,' Karmel, 51, said. Scroll down for video . Motivated mumpreneur: British children's cook book author Annabel Karmel, has over 40 books to her name . Paleo, puhlease... Karmel believes bone broth instead of breast milk or formula is dangerous and ill advised . As an expert on children's nutrition from babies through to toddlers, Karmel believes that, unlike Pete Evans' exclusion diet that recommends bone broth over breast milk, it is all about a well-rounded diet approach. 'Who is going to be making bone broth? 'I mean, it’s a lot of work and it’s also very low calorie amount of food,' she said. 'The baby won't have any nutrition they need - it’s entirely dangerous and I would definitely not advise that.' 'Children’s diets are slightly different to adult diets. When they’re young, the whole low-fat high fibre doesn't apply to children, they need high fats and not many high fibre foods because they deplete the body of nutrients when they’re young,' she added. Bad for bubba: Karmel says Pete Evan's kids cook book goes against everything health experts would advise . 'However, from two years old, provided they’re not underweight, they can have low-fat skim milk, but up until two they should have full fat milk, proper yoghurt and full fat everything. 'Yet a lot of people give them fruit and vegetables for far too long and they don’t have the nutrients they need to grow so children as a result become deficient in vitamins and minerals.' 'So it's really important babies have iron rich food, essential fatty acids and nutrient dense foods - which is basically the opposite of bone broth. 'They need cheese because their tummies are so small and they need energy because they’re running around, so cheese, avocado and meat have a high calorie content and that’s really important,' said Karmel. Fad foods: Karmel says she doesn't believe in fads and is against sugar free, paleo and low carb diets . 'So basically (the paleo diet) goes against everything that nutritionists and experts in child health would advise and I don’t know where he gets his advice from but I would not advise it.' At the mention of certain grains and carbohydrates being excluded, Karmel gasped. 'Sandwiches, breakfast cereals, pasta, all of those - are you saying you cannot have any of that? They're staples for children. If you can’t get them to eat something you can at least get them to eat spaghetti bolegnese. 'And in their lunch box they’d usually have a wrap or a sandwich, so what are they going to have? Bone broth?!' Karmel is also an advocate of good sugars despite popular beliefs currently surrounding the move towards complete sugar bans. ‘I’m not into fads, I prefer an all-round good diet but I’m not a purist either. If a child has an icecream or a chocolate it’s okay as well as long as it’s a part of a good diet. That's life - if you ban foods, they become forbidden treats and children will want them all the more,' she says. 'These exclusion diets don't make sense to me, you need protein, carbohydrates, you need fat, you need essential fatty acids and you need a balance of all these things.' Karmel crusade: Karmel is out to revolutionise healthy meals for kids with the launch of a new frozen food range . 'There’s sugar and then there is sugar. Fruit sugars are okay, and having an orange juice or a smoothie is okay. While it's not as good as eating the whole fruit (where you get the fibre) they still have a lot of nutrients in them.' 'It’s almost like juices and smoothies are now being promoted as not good for you – which is just not true,' she says. 'Yet, I would have chocolate cake or a bag of crisps in the fridge but my children didn't usually want to eat it because the food I made was healthy tasted delicious it was often better than the unhealthy food.' Obesity epidemic: Karmel says aside from diabetes and tooth decay, obese children are also not happy . Instead, Karmel believes balance is key. Mothers are working longer hours than ever before and she believes while they all start with good intentions and want to feed their children well, children get hungry, won't wait and so mothers are worn down into giving unhealthy, time-poor food substitutes like chocolate, chicken nuggets, pizza etc. As a mother of three herself, Karmel knows exactly the pressures facing new mums. Beginning her career after the tragic death of her first born Natasha, Karmel became extremely passionate about making recipes that would nourish her children that followed, as well as helping other mother's give their children food they would eat.

Ed Balls sparked a furious response from David Cameron earlier this month after he dismissed the letter as a 'jokey note'. The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by Mr Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy.

He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.'

Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up.

'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way.

The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by Mr Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is joined by his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez at The Devonshire Arms in Sheffield today . The Deputy Prime Minister is hoping his message that the Lib Dems can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party's dire position in the polls . He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left the original memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat . Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' The Prime Minister said Mr Balls's response was 'frankly the most appalling thing I have heard in this election campaign so far'. He claimed Balls was Ed Miliband's third choice to be shadow chancellor and was frankly 'the country's last choice to be put in charge of this nation's finances'. He said: 'The note that was left was correct. It said there was no money left. Let us think about the consequences of what we inherited and what we had to do. We had to make difficult decisions, we had to find efficiencies in government spending, we had to put up some taxes. 'We had to make some very very difficult decisions to get this country back on track. That note that said there is no money left was referring to the fact that our budget deficit was forecast to be bigger than the budget deficit in Greece when I became prime minister.'", "reference_summary": "Labour's Liam Byrne left a memo for the incoming Coalition government .

The Labour leader visited the Gurdwara – a Sikh temple – during a campaign tour of the Midlands on Wednesday. But his team banned national media journalists from the event – despite the fact that Gurdwaras are traditionally open to all. Worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the Labour leader, who had donned a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs. Scroll down for video . Behind closed doors: Ed Miliband, donning a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs, in secret footage from the Gurdwara . During the visit, Mr Miliband would answer only a small number of questions from the Sikh press. But even one of the Sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave Labour's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions. Davinder Singh, an adviser to the Sikh Federation who attended the visit, said the attitude of the Labour leader's team went against the ethos of his faith. He said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a Gurdwara are always open to all. And he suspected the Labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head-covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was 'offensive, even touching on racism'. He told the Daily Mail: 'The whole thing was very carefully stage managed. They said there will be no cameras whatsoever, they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a Gurdwara. Some of the party officials were downright rude. 'My children, who are three and six, were ushered out of the way. The whole thing did not feel right. 'It was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended. You don't do that in a Gurdwara – usher people around.' The incident will increase concern about the 'controlling' nature of Labour's election campaign, in which the Press and members of the public are kept at arm's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the Tories. Public visit: David Cameron at the Golden Temple in Amritsar . Mr Singh said he suspected Mr Miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the Sikh community but was 'worried about the reaction of non-Sikhs' if he was seen in the headgear at the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara. 'There's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the Sikh community,' he added. 'They wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a Gurdwara – but that he didn't want the publicity to go any wider.' Mr Singh, whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten-point Sikh Manifesto, said it was disappointing that Mr Miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about Labour's stance on Sikh issues. He added: 'Labour told the media it was a private visit, but that's nonsense. Was he going there for prayers? Of course not – it was part of the campaign.' Labour dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers. But it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent Mr Miliband creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run-up to the General Election. He has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past, including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader. Sky News broadcast footage on Wednesday evening showing the doors of the Gurdwara being closed after Mr Miliband entered. Only an official Labour Party photographer was allowed inside, and pictures were not released to the national media. The only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper. It showed that once inside, Mr Miliband took off his shoes and donned a red head-covering known as a ramal. He was also presented with a traditional orange scarf, or siropa, which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries. Broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused. But Mr Miliband held a brief Press briefing for three journalists from the Sikh media on Labour's battlebus. They were told they could each ask one question, which was agreed in advance. But a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question. He was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. A journalist from the Sikh media asked Mr Miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar (file picture used) Shalbinder Singh Malle, secretary of the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara, which co-operated with Labour over the visit, insisted worshippers were not offended by the event. He added: 'It went smoothly and we felt it was a success. 'We were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but I wouldn't say anyone was upset or offended by it. No one complained.' The row risks provoking cynicism about Mr Miliband's motives. Electoral experts believe Britain's 500,000 Sikhs could play a key role at next month's election. A Labour spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous and untrue to say that Ed Miliband did not want to be pictured at the Gurdwara. 'The visit was widely covered by the national and Sikh press and many worshippers took pictures inside with Ed Miliband. 'To respect worshippers in the prayer hall, Ed Miliband gave press interviews, including with the Sikh Federation, outside the temple.' But Mr Singh said the visit contrasted with a visit by David Cameron in February to the Gurdwara, adding: 'People who were there said it was very different. He was more relaxed and people could come and go, which is strange because you'd think the Prime Minister would have much tighter security.' Mr Cameron also visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar in 2013.", "reference_summary": "Labour leader accused of 'offensive' behaviour during visit to Sikh temple .

The Labour leader visited the Gurdwara – a Sikh temple – during a campaign tour of the Midlands on Wednesday. But his team banned national media journalists from the event – despite the fact that Gurdwaras are traditionally open to all. Worshippers were also banned from using cameras and phones to take pictures of the Labour leader, who had donned a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs. Scroll down for video . Behind closed doors: Ed Miliband, donning a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs, in secret footage from the Gurdwara . During the visit, Mr Miliband would answer only a small number of questions from the Sikh press. But even one of the Sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave Labour's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions. Davinder Singh, an adviser to the Sikh Federation who attended the visit, said the attitude of the Labour leader's team went against the ethos of his faith. He said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a Gurdwara are always open to all. And he suspected the Labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head-covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was 'offensive, even touching on racism'. He told the Daily Mail: 'The whole thing was very carefully stage managed. They said there will be no cameras whatsoever, they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a Gurdwara. Some of the party officials were downright rude. 'My children, who are three and six, were ushered out of the way. The whole thing did not feel right. 'It was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended. You don't do that in a Gurdwara – usher people around.' The incident will increase concern about the 'controlling' nature of Labour's election campaign, in which the Press and members of the public are kept at arm's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the Tories. Public visit: David Cameron at the Golden Temple in Amritsar . Mr Singh said he suspected Mr Miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the Sikh community but was 'worried about the reaction of non-Sikhs' if he was seen in the headgear at the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara. 'There's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the Sikh community,' he added. 'They wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a Gurdwara – but that he didn't want the publicity to go any wider.' Mr Singh, whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten-point Sikh Manifesto, said it was disappointing that Mr Miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about Labour's stance on Sikh issues. He added: 'Labour told the media it was a private visit, but that's nonsense. Was he going there for prayers? Of course not – it was part of the campaign.' Labour dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers. But it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent Mr Miliband creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run-up to the General Election. He has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past, including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader. Sky News broadcast footage on Wednesday evening showing the doors of the Gurdwara being closed after Mr Miliband entered. Only an official Labour Party photographer was allowed inside, and pictures were not released to the national media. The only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper. It showed that once inside, Mr Miliband took off his shoes and donned a red head-covering known as a ramal. He was also presented with a traditional orange scarf, or siropa, which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries. Broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused. But Mr Miliband held a brief Press briefing for three journalists from the Sikh media on Labour's battlebus. They were told they could each ask one question, which was agreed in advance. But a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question. He was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. A journalist from the Sikh media asked Mr Miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar (file picture used) Shalbinder Singh Malle, secretary of the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara, which co-operated with Labour over the visit, insisted worshippers were not offended by the event. He added: 'It went smoothly and we felt it was a success. 'We were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but I wouldn't say anyone was upset or offended by it.

Behind closed doors: Ed Miliband, donning a red head-covering to comply with Sikh customs, in secret footage from the Gurdwara . During the visit, Mr Miliband would answer only a small number of questions from the Sikh press. But even one of the Sikh journalists was allegedly asked to leave Labour's battlebus after straying from a list of agreed questions. Davinder Singh, an adviser to the Sikh Federation who attended the visit, said the attitude of the Labour leader's team went against the ethos of his faith. He said the decision to shut people out of the temple contradicted the tradition that the doors to a Gurdwara are always open to all. And he suspected the Labour leader did not want to be widely pictured in a head-covering in case the pictures were embarrassing – something he said was 'offensive, even touching on racism'. He told the Daily Mail: 'The whole thing was very carefully stage managed. They said there will be no cameras whatsoever, they were telling people not to even use their phones to take any pictures inside – that is unheard of inside a Gurdwara. Some of the party officials were downright rude. 'My children, who are three and six, were ushered out of the way. The whole thing did not feel right. 'It was a missed opportunity on his part and it left some people feeling offended. You don't do that in a Gurdwara – usher people around.' The incident will increase concern about the 'controlling' nature of Labour's election campaign, in which the Press and members of the public are kept at arm's length from the party leader – a criticism also levelled at the Tories.

Mr Singh said he suspected Mr Miliband was trying to ingratiate himself with the Sikh community but was 'worried about the reaction of non-Sikhs' if he was seen in the headgear at the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara. 'There's a feeling that they wanted publicity within the Sikh community,' he added. 'They wanted people to know he had ticked the box of visiting a Gurdwara – but that he didn't want the publicity to go any wider.' Mr Singh, whose organisation is urging politicians to sign up to a ten-point Sikh Manifesto, said it was disappointing that Mr Miliband had refused to pose for pictures or make a public statement about Labour's stance on Sikh issues. He added: 'Labour told the media it was a private visit, but that's nonsense. Was he going there for prayers? Of course not – it was part of the campaign.' Labour dismissed the criticism and said journalists were barred out of respect to worshippers. But it is thought that campaign chiefs are determined to prevent Mr Miliband creating an embarrassing photo opportunity in the run-up to the General Election. He has endured a string of such photo opportunities in the past, including excruciating pictures of him trying to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year. Labour campaign bosses are determined to prevent similar gaffes and are exerting tight control on access to the leader. Sky News broadcast footage on Wednesday evening showing the doors of the Gurdwara being closed after Mr Miliband entered. Only an official Labour Party photographer was allowed inside, and pictures were not released to the national media. The only images of him inside came from shaky mobile phone footage smuggled out by a worshipper. It showed that once inside, Mr Miliband took off his shoes and donned a red head-covering known as a ramal. He was also presented with a traditional orange scarf, or siropa, which is given as a mark of respect to dignitaries. Broadcasters requested access to the event but were refused. But Mr Miliband held a brief Press briefing for three journalists from the Sikh media on Labour's battlebus. They were told they could each ask one question, which was agreed in advance. But a witness said one was asked to leave after departing from the agreed question. He was eventually allowed to stay and ask if the party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. A journalist from the Sikh media asked Mr Miliband if his party would back an independent inquiry into the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar (file picture used) Shalbinder Singh Malle, secretary of the Leamington and Warwick Gurdwara, which co-operated with Labour over the visit, insisted worshippers were not offended by the event. He added: 'It went smoothly and we felt it was a success. 'We were told not to take pictures and one or two people may have been disappointed but I wouldn't say anyone was upset or offended by it. No one complained.' The row risks provoking cynicism about Mr Miliband's motives. Electoral experts believe Britain's 500,000 Sikhs could play a key role at next month's election. A Labour spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous and untrue to say that Ed Miliband did not want to be pictured at the Gurdwara. 'The visit was widely covered by the national and Sikh press and many worshippers took pictures inside with Ed Miliband. 'To respect worshippers in the prayer hall, Ed Miliband gave press interviews, including with the Sikh Federation, outside the temple.'

Fourteen others were convicted on the same charges, with most also sentenced to 20 years in jail. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Egypt's former president Mohamed Morsi (pictured at an court appearance in December) has been sentenced to 20 years for ordering the arrest and torture of protesters in 2012 . But the court cleared the defendants on charges of inciting murder over the deaths of a journalist and two protesters during the December 5, 2012 clashes outside the presidential palace in Cairo. Defence lawyers said they would launch an appeal against the convictions. Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected leader, came to power following the 2011 ouster of Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. But after just a year in power, Morsi was himself toppled by then-army chief and now President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass street protests. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood has been blacklisted and targeted in a government crackdown that has seen hundreds killed and thousands thrown in jail. Other Brotherhood leaders have been sentenced to death and Tuesday's decision to acquit Morsi on the incitement to murder charge was unexpected. 'This is a surprise... We were expecting them to be convicted of murder,' Ramy Ghanem, a lawyer for an anti-Morsi protester who was wounded in the clashes, told AFP. Buses were set ablaze during 2012 clashes between opponents and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . 'But the sentences are not bad. We were expecting life in prison, but then 20 years is not very different,' he said. A life sentence in Egypt is 25 years. Hundreds of Morsi supporters have been sentenced to death in speedy mass trials which the United Nations has called 'unprecedented in recent history'. Earlier this month, a Cairo court confirmed death sentences for Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie and 13 others over protest violence. The Brotherhood had called for protests in support of Morsi on Tuesday. 'The coup commander is exploiting the judiciary,' it said in a statement ahead of the verdict, referring to Sisi. It said the president was using the courts 'as a weapon in the battle against the popular will and the democratic and revolutionary legitimacy represented by President Mohamed Morsi.' Morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty, including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers. Verdicts in those two cases are due on May 16. Sisi has vowed to 'eradicate' the Brotherhood, an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's presidential election victory in May 2012. Supporters and opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the Mediterranean coastal city of Alexandria . The authorities designated it a 'terrorist group' in December 2013, making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms. The crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups, who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces. Officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since Morsi was overthrown. Sisi was elected president in May last year, but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by Mubarak's ouster of a civilian democracy. Sisi's regime is popular among many Egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth.

'Bread has been a dietary staple for thousands of years, and the more advanced technology has become, so too the more processed our bread, resulting in the soft, almost sticky common white loaf many families base a number of meals around each day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bread, white or otherwise is a rich source of B group vitamins which are crucial for energy production, and hence bread remains a major contributor to energy and the running of energy systems in the body. 'Less processed varieties of bread also offer a range of other nutrients including dietary fibre, Vitamin E, zinc; iron and long chain unsaturated fats, which is generally why loaves of grain based bread contain more fat than white bread,' she added. The nutritionist said there is a distinct difference in the nutritional value of white and grain bread, there's also a disparity in the glycaemic index (GI). The best: Tip Top 9 Grain (right) and Helga's Lower Carb (right) came highly recommended from Susie Burrell . 'As white, wholemeal and flat breads have all had the grains ground down in their processing, they have a relatively high GI compared to wholegrain bread, meaning that they release glucose into the bloodstream much more quickly than wholegrain breads,' Ms Burrell said. 'Over time, this means that choosing processed breads as a dietary staple will be resulting in regular glucose peaks and troughs, and subsequent insulin release. 'High insulin levels over time are related to weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,' she added. This comes as experts in the UK have warned of the long-term effects of completely cutting out one food group from your daily diet. In light of this the diet guru has compiled a list of the five most nutritious, and five worst breads Australian consumers can buy. BarleyMax wraps also rated highly on the Australian nutritionist's list, coming in third in her top five . Baker's Delight Cape Seed loaf (left) was given the nod by the nutritionist, as was Burgen's Soy Lin (right) 'One of the most commonly asked questions in relation to bread choice is whether ‘wholemeal’ is a good choice. While whole meal bread does contain more dietary fibre than standard white bread, it is still a high GI choice,' Ms Burrell revealed. Swap it: Australian nutritionist Susie Burrell says while too many processed carbohydrates can be bad, people shouldn't generally be eliminating them entirely but instead looking at healthier options . She said Turkish breads can be one of the worst as people tend to eat it in higher quantities and fill the holes with butter or margarine. 'The average adult will need just 2-4 slices of bread each day and be mindful of the increasing sizes,' the nutritionist warned. 'Some large, thick slices of bread can contain up to double the amount of carbohydrates and are really not necessary for the majority of us who would ultimately like to drop a few extra kilograms. 'As many Australians eat bread on a daily basis, it is imperative that our choice of bread is gold standard, and this means grain bread,' she added. Ms Burrell also warned parents to be cautious of the bread they're serving their children, as they will learn what they know. 'If you continue to buy white bread, they will continue to eat it, and it is not the best choice nutritionally for their health long term,' she said. While it's widely accepted that processed carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, can contribute to weight gain and its associated diseases, doctors are increasingly concerned about a trend for excluding all carbs - even healthier wholegrains, where the grain is left intact and not processed. People who do this could suffer from a lack of energy, mood swings, poor concentration and gut problems - and may even put on weight. Those who shun carbs say they are bad for us because they convert into sugar in the body, and can cause weight gain because we store excess sugar as fat. Lawson white bread was named as the worst nutritionally, due to its high calorie and sodium counts . Lebanese bread (left) and Turkish bread (right) were also listed unfavourably by Ms Burrell . But while many experts agree that overweight people often do eat too many carbs, they also say that these foods have been unfairly demonised. 'Carbs are seen by many as the \"devil\" food, but any dietitian will tell you they are an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet - the general guidance is they should make up a third of our intake,' says Helen Bond, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'They are a ready source of fuel for the body. Cutting them out can cause headaches, tiredness and lethargy. 'You won't be able to perform so well during exercise and concentration is likely to be affected, too, because carbohydrates also fuel the brain.' She adds that where people go wrong is in treating all carbs as the same. Burgen Soya & Linseed Bread . Calories: 111kcal . Carbs: 12g . Fibre: 4.1g . Sodium: 0.13g .

'Bread has been a dietary staple for thousands of years, and the more advanced technology has become, so too the more processed our bread, resulting in the soft, almost sticky common white loaf many families base a number of meals around each day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bread, white or otherwise is a rich source of B group vitamins which are crucial for energy production, and hence bread remains a major contributor to energy and the running of energy systems in the body. 'Less processed varieties of bread also offer a range of other nutrients including dietary fibre, Vitamin E, zinc; iron and long chain unsaturated fats, which is generally why loaves of grain based bread contain more fat than white bread,' she added. The nutritionist said there is a distinct difference in the nutritional value of white and grain bread, there's also a disparity in the glycaemic index (GI). The best: Tip Top 9 Grain (right) and Helga's Lower Carb (right) came highly recommended from Susie Burrell . 'As white, wholemeal and flat breads have all had the grains ground down in their processing, they have a relatively high GI compared to wholegrain bread, meaning that they release glucose into the bloodstream much more quickly than wholegrain breads,' Ms Burrell said. 'Over time, this means that choosing processed breads as a dietary staple will be resulting in regular glucose peaks and troughs, and subsequent insulin release. 'High insulin levels over time are related to weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,' she added. This comes as experts in the UK have warned of the long-term effects of completely cutting out one food group from your daily diet. In light of this the diet guru has compiled a list of the five most nutritious, and five worst breads Australian consumers can buy. BarleyMax wraps also rated highly on the Australian nutritionist's list, coming in third in her top five . Baker's Delight Cape Seed loaf (left) was given the nod by the nutritionist, as was Burgen's Soy Lin (right) 'One of the most commonly asked questions in relation to bread choice is whether ‘wholemeal’ is a good choice. While whole meal bread does contain more dietary fibre than standard white bread, it is still a high GI choice,' Ms Burrell revealed. Swap it: Australian nutritionist Susie Burrell says while too many processed carbohydrates can be bad, people shouldn't generally be eliminating them entirely but instead looking at healthier options . She said Turkish breads can be one of the worst as people tend to eat it in higher quantities and fill the holes with butter or margarine. 'The average adult will need just 2-4 slices of bread each day and be mindful of the increasing sizes,' the nutritionist warned. 'Some large, thick slices of bread can contain up to double the amount of carbohydrates and are really not necessary for the majority of us who would ultimately like to drop a few extra kilograms. 'As many Australians eat bread on a daily basis, it is imperative that our choice of bread is gold standard, and this means grain bread,' she added. Ms Burrell also warned parents to be cautious of the bread they're serving their children, as they will learn what they know. 'If you continue to buy white bread, they will continue to eat it, and it is not the best choice nutritionally for their health long term,' she said. While it's widely accepted that processed carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, can contribute to weight gain and its associated diseases, doctors are increasingly concerned about a trend for excluding all carbs - even healthier wholegrains, where the grain is left intact and not processed. People who do this could suffer from a lack of energy, mood swings, poor concentration and gut problems - and may even put on weight. Those who shun carbs say they are bad for us because they convert into sugar in the body, and can cause weight gain because we store excess sugar as fat. Lawson white bread was named as the worst nutritionally, due to its high calorie and sodium counts . Lebanese bread (left) and Turkish bread (right) were also listed unfavourably by Ms Burrell . But while many experts agree that overweight people often do eat too many carbs, they also say that these foods have been unfairly demonised. 'Carbs are seen by many as the \"devil\" food, but any dietitian will tell you they are an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet - the general guidance is they should make up a third of our intake,' says Helen Bond, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'They are a ready source of fuel for the body. Cutting them out can cause headaches, tiredness and lethargy. 'You won't be able to perform so well during exercise and concentration is likely to be affected, too, because carbohydrates also fuel the brain.' She adds that where people go wrong is in treating all carbs as the same. Burgen Soya & Linseed Bread . Calories: 111kcal . Carbs: 12g . Fibre: 4.1g . Sodium: 0.13g .

'You won't be able to perform so well during exercise and concentration is likely to be affected, too, because carbohydrates also fuel the brain.' She adds that where people go wrong is in treating all carbs as the same. Burgen Soya & Linseed Bread . Calories: 111kcal . Carbs: 12g . Fibre: 4.1g . Sodium: 0.13g .

But doctors are concerned with the increasing trend that's seeing people cut whole food groups out of their diets, especially healthier options like wholegrains. As revealed by the Daily Mail on Tuesday, experts warn that shunning an entire food group is unsustainable, can damage one's relationship with food and could be doing more harm than good. Australian dietician and nutritionist Susie Burrell agrees with the research that points to white bread and heavily processed carbohydrates as contributors for weight gain, but says this is no reason to cut all carbs out completely.

'Bread has been a dietary staple for thousands of years, and the more advanced technology has become, so too the more processed our bread, resulting in the soft, almost sticky common white loaf many families base a number of meals around each day,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bread, white or otherwise is a rich source of B group vitamins which are crucial for energy production, and hence bread remains a major contributor to energy and the running of energy systems in the body. 'Less processed varieties of bread also offer a range of other nutrients including dietary fibre, Vitamin E, zinc; iron and long chain unsaturated fats, which is generally why loaves of grain based bread contain more fat than white bread,' she added. The nutritionist said there is a distinct difference in the nutritional value of white and grain bread, there's also a disparity in the glycaemic index (GI). The best: Tip Top 9 Grain (right) and Helga's Lower Carb (right) came highly recommended from Susie Burrell . 'As white, wholemeal and flat breads have all had the grains ground down in their processing, they have a relatively high GI compared to wholegrain bread, meaning that they release glucose into the bloodstream much more quickly than wholegrain breads,' Ms Burrell said. 'Over time, this means that choosing processed breads as a dietary staple will be resulting in regular glucose peaks and troughs, and subsequent insulin release. 'High insulin levels over time are related to weight gain and increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes,' she added. This comes as experts in the UK have warned of the long-term effects of completely cutting out one food group from your daily diet. In light of this the diet guru has compiled a list of the five most nutritious, and five worst breads Australian consumers can buy. BarleyMax wraps also rated highly on the Australian nutritionist's list, coming in third in her top five . Baker's Delight Cape Seed loaf (left) was given the nod by the nutritionist, as was Burgen's Soy Lin (right) 'One of the most commonly asked questions in relation to bread choice is whether ‘wholemeal’ is a good choice. While whole meal bread does contain more dietary fibre than standard white bread, it is still a high GI choice,' Ms Burrell revealed. Swap it: Australian nutritionist Susie Burrell says while too many processed carbohydrates can be bad, people shouldn't generally be eliminating them entirely but instead looking at healthier options . She said Turkish breads can be one of the worst as people tend to eat it in higher quantities and fill the holes with butter or margarine. 'The average adult will need just 2-4 slices of bread each day and be mindful of the increasing sizes,' the nutritionist warned. 'Some large, thick slices of bread can contain up to double the amount of carbohydrates and are really not necessary for the majority of us who would ultimately like to drop a few extra kilograms. 'As many Australians eat bread on a daily basis, it is imperative that our choice of bread is gold standard, and this means grain bread,' she added. Ms Burrell also warned parents to be cautious of the bread they're serving their children, as they will learn what they know. 'If you continue to buy white bread, they will continue to eat it, and it is not the best choice nutritionally for their health long term,' she said. While it's widely accepted that processed carbohydrates, such as white bread and pasta, can contribute to weight gain and its associated diseases, doctors are increasingly concerned about a trend for excluding all carbs - even healthier wholegrains, where the grain is left intact and not processed. People who do this could suffer from a lack of energy, mood swings, poor concentration and gut problems - and may even put on weight. Those who shun carbs say they are bad for us because they convert into sugar in the body, and can cause weight gain because we store excess sugar as fat.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits .

It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.'

But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years . The remarkable finding of ‘foreign DNA’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as ‘nature’s genetic engineer.’ It is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species.

It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old . ‘The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,’ said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. ‘It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.’ The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process.

But new research has found that Mother Nature might be making its own GM food, as sweet potatoes have been found to genetically modify themselves. And this seems to have been occurring for thousands of years, meaning humans have been unknowingly eating GM foods for much longer than they thought. Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes (stock image shown) contain 'foreign DNA'. Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species. This makes sweet potatoes a 'natural genetically modified organism'. And humans have been eating it for thousands of years . The remarkable finding of ‘foreign DNA’ in the vegetable shows that it contains a type of natural genetically modified organism (GMO). The research was conducted by scientists from Ghent University in Belgium and the International Potato Institute (CIP). Sweet potato is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old. Despite the name, sweet potato is not related to potato; we eat the tuber from potato, while from sweet potato mainly the storage root is eaten. Other sweet potato parts are edible, such as the leaves. It is not the first instance of natural GMOs to be found, but it is the first in sweet potatoes - a major crop plant. And the researchers say sweet potatoes all over the world contain this genetic modification. The study focused around bacteria called Agrobacterium, sometimes referred to as ‘nature’s genetic engineer.’ It is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. Agrobacterium is specialised to transfer part of its own DNA, called T-DNA, to plants - and it was this T-DNA that was found in sweet potatoes. In total the researchers studied 291 samples of sweet potato from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania, and found evidence of Agrobacterium in all of them. Agrobacterium is known to do something called ‘horizontal gene transfer’, which involves exchanging genes between different species - in contrast to normal gene transfer within one species. This so-called transgenic process is similar to the artificial process induced by humans (stock image shown) Sweet potato (shown) is one of the most important food crops for human consumption, especially in Sub-Sahara Africa, parts of Asia and the Pacific islands. It is one of the earliest domesticated crops with archeological findings in caves of the Cholca Canyon in Peru that are 8,000 to 10,000 years old . ‘The natural presence of Agrobacterium T-DNA in sweet potato and its stable inheritance during evolution is a beautiful example of the possibility of DNA exchange across species barriers,’ said Dr Lieve Gheysen, one of the researchers involved. ‘It demonstrates that genetic modification also happens in nature.’ The research suggests that the bacterial DNA may have adapted sweet potato for thousands of years in the natural process. The transgenic process - a gene that has been transferred naturally - is similar to the artificial process induced by humans. However, the difference pointed out by the resarchers is that we can control the man-made process, while the natural process is out of our hands. ‘In comparison to \"natural\" GMOs, that are beyond our control, human-made GMOs have the advantage that we know exactly which characteristic we add to the plant,’ said Dr Gheysen.", "reference_summary": "Scientists in Belgium say all sweet potatoes contain 'foreign DNA' Agrobacterium bacteria in the crop exchanges genes between species .

Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash?

I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly.

VOUCHERS PAST USE-BY DATES . As a dedicated bargain-hunter, it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully-collected discount vouchers have expired. Janet is a self-confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date . ANYTHING CALLED ‘AN EXPERIENCE’ Shopping has become a pastime, like making raffia mats or embroidery, and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘experience’. Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash? This drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in Boots. Janet remains baffled by pay-by-phone car parking, what's wrong with cash? QUEUE-JUMPERS AT AIRPORTS . After patiently waiting my turn, I could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘friend’ in the queue in front on me. SUPERFOODS . Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of ‘de-planing’ (don’t they mean ‘disembarking’ or ‘getting off’)? Railway stations are described as ‘calling points’. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians ‘jubilating’ after the country’s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘stake-holders’. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the ‘re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: ‘It doesn’t work!’ ‘Re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil’s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it’s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly.

Now the pretty redhead from West Sussex has shared her story with the world in a bid to rid the stigma around those living with a stoma (a surgically created opening in the abdomen) and a bag. Writing on her amusingly frank and startlingly honest blog morethanyourbag.com, Hattie opens up about life after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Hattie Gladwell was fitted with an ostomy bag after under-going surgery for ulcerative colitis, now she shares her experience on her blog morethanyourbag.com . She reveals all about what it's like to wear a bikini for the first time, how to have sex with a bag and how learning to live with it has affected her mental health. Hattie was admitted to hospital on January 26th of this year although she had long suffered from problems with her health after an inflammatory bowel condition was misdiagnosed. She told MailOnline: 'I was sent into hospital with suspected appendicitis, but after two failed colonoscopies, my appendix out and excruciating pain, I finally had emergency surgery for my stoma. 'The cause turned out to be ulcerative colitis but the symptoms had been fobbed off as \"women's troubles\" for years.' Ulcerative colitis is a long term condition where the colon and the rectum become inflamed and things became so bad for Hattie, she had to have her colon removed and an ileostomy bag fitted into her small intestine. She found the change to her body difficult to deal with. She said: 'At first, I was scared I wouldn't be able to live a normal life. I was scared of what people would think, and how I could go on to hide it. Hattie says that her boyfriend has been a great support - on her blog she details how the couple have maintained their sex life with her bag . 'For the first few weeks I was unable to look down at my stomach without wanting to cry. 'At only 19, there is so much pressure to be attractive to society that I wasn't sure I would cope with something that wasn't deemed \"normal\".' The ostomy bag would collect waste from Hattie's body which had been diverted through her stoma. But before long brave Hattie decided that she could not let the operation or her bag ruin her life. She said: 'A couple of weeks after surgery, I decided the worst thing I could do to myself was hide such a traumatic experience. 'My stoma is a part of me now it is what saved my life and I have no reason to be ashamed of that.' Hattie has a stoma (left) through which waste passes from her body into her bag (right) Hattie has opened up about what it was like to wear her bikini again for the first time since she had her bag fitted saying she felt happy to be in the water . She her blog which she explains is, 'a blog for those getting used to life with a stoma.' She said: 'Since speaking out, I have come to terms with my body and the change it has faced. I have become determined to make sure my life doesn't change. And I love it. 'I've never felt more open minded, I've never appreciated life more. My life hasn't changed in the slightest, if anything, I've changed. I've become more confident after choosing to embrace my body. 'I've become more understanding, and now all I want to do is raise awareness for IBD [inflammatory bowel disease] and ostomy.' Hattie revealed that she's had a huge amount of support from her friends and family, especially her mother. She said: 'My mum was pretty much my rock during the whole thing. She spent the first couple of weeks helping me with my bag before I became more independent again. I wouldn't have coped without her.' On her blog Hattie shares her experiences of getting back to normal life with a stoma. Including putting on a bikini for the first time. Since having her bag fitted Hattie has tried to continue her life as normal, pictured here dressed up with a friend for a night out . She revealed: 'Going out in my bikini was a little nerve racking. But although I started off feeling self-conscious I quickly realised that this is the body that I will be living with, and that if I wanted to do things deemed as \"normal\" I needed to get over any flaws I feel are there.' Hattie continued: 'I also needed to forget about what other people may or may not think. Because it's not their opinion that is going to keep me going – it's mine. 'I decided to wear a bikini because I remembered how good I felt wearing it last year - my first ever bikini that I'd had the courage to buy after being so body conscious for so long. 'I remembered how little fear I felt when people looked at me. I didn't want to fall back into that place where I'd hide in my towel as soon as I got out of the water. 'I told myself that my stoma is nothing to be ashamed of. So I wore the bikini that made me feel beautiful last year, and instead of falling two steps back, I moved one step further towards that self esteem I so desperately want to maintain.' Hattie plans to keep her blog going full time and says that she hopes to raise more awareness of people living with an ostomy bag . Hattie shared another photo of herself with her ostomy bag attached to her stomach . Describing the moment she headed for the pool Hattie said: 'I left the changing rooms and walked over to the pool. As my is scar very prominent I was expecting stares and fingers. But my expectations were wrong. 'Nobody stared, nobody pointed. I slowly got into the pool – not wanting to jump in, in case the pressure of the water caused my bag to float away. 'I was able to get into the pool with ease and began swimming. The water felt amazing. I couldn't even feel my bag while in the water. 'It was as if for that amount of time none of this year had happened, no surgery, no stoma, no bag. I was taken back to last year, I felt as if I was back on that same day where I felt absolutely amazing. 'I swam a few lengths before getting out to use the steam room. I was a little breathless as it was the most exercise I'd done in a while.' Hattie also says that her boyfriend Angelo Caponi has been a big part of rebuilding her confidence. She said: 'My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, meeting early 2013. We live together so there's not really much choice but to be open with him about everything. 'Which has actually been great for me as I feel so comfortable with my body around him. Our sex life hasn't changed one bit. 'Of course, the first few weeks we were very cautious and he was a bit wary as he didn't want to hurt me. 'But for me, sex was never an issue. We always had such an active sex life before the surgery and I didn't want that to change.'

'My stoma is a part of me now it is what saved my life and I have no reason to be ashamed of that.' Hattie has a stoma (left) through which waste passes from her body into her bag (right) Hattie has opened up about what it was like to wear her bikini again for the first time since she had her bag fitted saying she felt happy to be in the water . She her blog which she explains is, 'a blog for those getting used to life with a stoma.' She said: 'Since speaking out, I have come to terms with my body and the change it has faced. I have become determined to make sure my life doesn't change. And I love it. 'I've never felt more open minded, I've never appreciated life more. My life hasn't changed in the slightest, if anything, I've changed. I've become more confident after choosing to embrace my body. 'I've become more understanding, and now all I want to do is raise awareness for IBD [inflammatory bowel disease] and ostomy.' Hattie revealed that she's had a huge amount of support from her friends and family, especially her mother. She said: 'My mum was pretty much my rock during the whole thing. She spent the first couple of weeks helping me with my bag before I became more independent again. I wouldn't have coped without her.' On her blog Hattie shares her experiences of getting back to normal life with a stoma. Including putting on a bikini for the first time. Since having her bag fitted Hattie has tried to continue her life as normal, pictured here dressed up with a friend for a night out . She revealed: 'Going out in my bikini was a little nerve racking. But although I started off feeling self-conscious I quickly realised that this is the body that I will be living with, and that if I wanted to do things deemed as \"normal\" I needed to get over any flaws I feel are there.' Hattie continued: 'I also needed to forget about what other people may or may not think. Because it's not their opinion that is going to keep me going – it's mine. 'I decided to wear a bikini because I remembered how good I felt wearing it last year - my first ever bikini that I'd had the courage to buy after being so body conscious for so long. 'I remembered how little fear I felt when people looked at me. I didn't want to fall back into that place where I'd hide in my towel as soon as I got out of the water. 'I told myself that my stoma is nothing to be ashamed of. So I wore the bikini that made me feel beautiful last year, and instead of falling two steps back, I moved one step further towards that self esteem I so desperately want to maintain.' Hattie plans to keep her blog going full time and says that she hopes to raise more awareness of people living with an ostomy bag . Hattie shared another photo of herself with her ostomy bag attached to her stomach . Describing the moment she headed for the pool Hattie said: 'I left the changing rooms and walked over to the pool. As my is scar very prominent I was expecting stares and fingers. But my expectations were wrong. 'Nobody stared, nobody pointed. I slowly got into the pool – not wanting to jump in, in case the pressure of the water caused my bag to float away. 'I was able to get into the pool with ease and began swimming. The water felt amazing. I couldn't even feel my bag while in the water. 'It was as if for that amount of time none of this year had happened, no surgery, no stoma, no bag. I was taken back to last year, I felt as if I was back on that same day where I felt absolutely amazing. 'I swam a few lengths before getting out to use the steam room. I was a little breathless as it was the most exercise I'd done in a while.' Hattie also says that her boyfriend Angelo Caponi has been a big part of rebuilding her confidence. She said: 'My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, meeting early 2013. We live together so there's not really much choice but to be open with him about everything. 'Which has actually been great for me as I feel so comfortable with my body around him. Our sex life hasn't changed one bit. 'Of course, the first few weeks we were very cautious and he was a bit wary as he didn't want to hurt me. 'But for me, sex was never an issue. We always had such an active sex life before the surgery and I didn't want that to change.'

And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo. His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout. Instead, we got a maths lecture on the points position at the top of the table. And a description of John Terry’s performance as ‘from the moon.’ Mourinho patrols the touchline as the Chelsea boss saw his side take another step toward the title . Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one. Something Sky Sports spotted early on was the deal, and very wisely chose not to try too hard to shoehorn in melodrama where none existed. And why should they? After all, everyone will be back next year for more of the same. So what’s the rush?", "reference_summary": "Wenger and Mourinho faced off once more as Arsenal and Chelsea contested a 0-0 draw .

His arms raised in the natural position for a man exclaiming ‘how wasn’t that a handball?’ Back in the studio at half time, Thierry looked just as surprised as his old boss had, as he exclaimed ‘Two? Wow!’ when Jamie Carragher said he thought Chelsea had a pair of good shouts from twelve yards. However, not for the first or last time he revealed his true colours when he admitted he thought there had indeed been one for the west London team. ‘I was showing my Arsenal side earlier’, Henry confessed. In his case, proverbially holding his hands up in the box. Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry and Graeme Souness chew the fat after the final whistle . Into the second half, and on co-commentary Alan Smith made the point very early that Arsenal would be happy ‘in their quest to finish second’. And it became pretty clear pretty quickly that there were in fact two teams out there who’d take one point each. All of which meant the spotlights reserved for any Arsene and Jose fireworks were left dimmed throughout. We didn’t even get any awkward gaffer-on-gaffer action at the final whistle. Instead, just the sight of Mourinho disappearing down the tunnel with the draw tucked away inside his voluminous coat. And John Terry securing the right to be last image in the show with his enthusiastic shadow-boxing celebration. Indeed, by the time Sky had tracked down both managers back in the tunnel, it had reverted to the pre-game chill out zone they had created before kick off. Reporter Patrick Davidson’s attempt to get the Chelsea manager to bite only proved that Jose just wasn’t that hungry. ‘I have no comment’, he continued to reply, his face impassive throughout.

Someone had clearly relit those joss sticks, because Arsene too failed to take the bait when his head to head to Jose was broached. ‘It’s not about me, it’s about my team and my club’, he smiled, before deftly acknowledging an excellent Chelsea side without also paying dues to his opposite number. So in the end, both men effectively breasted the tape together (although they weren’t exactly holding hands in the process), finishing equal first in this particular one.

And yes, it might well have been entertaining to see the pair - one dressed as a clown, say, and the other a superhero - having it out on the streets while Crammy and Brendan told us some fascinating facts about historical landmarks. Perhaps they can do that next year? This year, instead, once the actual race was run, all roads led to the Emirates and a Sky Sports team all set to act as pacemaker for the afternoon. Arsene Wenger has a look in the direction of Jose Mourinho during the stalemate at the Emirates . And, yes, of course they did bother to point out that there also happened to be an important game of football going on. One with the added factor of Cesc Fabregas happening to be the man in the middle, on a couple of levels. But surely there was never any doubt which two men were going to set the tone for what was about to come. Having just made it sound like some kind of Premier League Mayweather vs Pacquiao match up, in fact both bosses were far from being in a combative mood in their pre match interviews. Jose was nigh on glowing about Arsenal’s ‘creative team (with) amazing, fantastic solutions.’ While Arsene said one of the important motivators for his team was ‘to share positive emotions with our fans.’ It sounded like someone had just broken out the joss sticks in the tunnel. Perhaps a little more in-your-face were the pundits in the booth. Here Thierry ‘as an Arsenal man’ Henry found himself getting mildly bad cop/bad copped by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness over the former Gunners striker’s contention that ‘it was kind of weird to see (Cesc Fabregas) in a blue shirt’ and that ‘if I was the boss I would tried to buy him back.’ But this really was just everyone jostling for position at the starting gun. The race was yet to be run. In the first half of the encounter, it was the penalty shouts that saw the director scrambling, to switch to Gaffercam. The first image was a beauty, capturing both men together on the touchline after Oscar and Ospina had collided. Oscar and David Ospina collided with the Chelsea man taken to hospital for a suspected concussion . In the foreground, Mourinho dispensed with the pre-game purple prose and was using an entirely different vocabulary to berate the fourth official. While in the distance, Wenger looked on with the benign countenance of a man who perhaps thought he’d got away with one? Each was then given their own live hero shot. Jose was simply stoney-faced for his, by the time the camera had found him after the Fabregas yellow for an adjudged dive. But Arsene’s solo was much more dramatic. A handball shout against Cahill rejected, the Arsenal boss had by now donned one of his famous zip up coats and was captured in glorious slo-mo.

Because they left Spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins, over Peru and the USA, the booing, whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win Euro 2008. Three trophies later, the senior team is finally in search of a reboot. The identity has been eroded by the passage of time. The transition from excellent to elderly is never fun. Spain lift the trophy at Euro 2008, but their fans had booed them before, not recognising a great team . The World Cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters . Spain won the European Championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their World Cup failure . Spain's Under 21s celebrate winning Euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now . Nevertheless, the current Champions League quarter-finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about Spain's 'relevo'. If you don't speak Spanish, that term might mean very little to you. But I bet you can intuit. 'Relevo' in this context is like 'relief' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch. Those who are sent in, fresh and ready, to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days. Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a \"Spanish school\" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just \"training\" and \"playing\". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'", "reference_summary": "When Spain first became a real power, their own fans didn't know at first .

Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a \"Spanish school\" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just \"training\" and \"playing\". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'", "reference_summary": "When Spain first became a real power, their own fans didn't know at first .

Because they left Spanish soil having eked out two single-goal wins, over Peru and the USA, the booing, whistling and jeering which had pursued them around the peninsula for two years was the last thing they heard before heading off to win Euro 2008. Three trophies later, the senior team is finally in search of a reboot. The identity has been eroded by the passage of time. The transition from excellent to elderly is never fun. Spain lift the trophy at Euro 2008, but their fans had booed them before, not recognising a great team . The World Cup followed in 2010 and now it seems the right time for the old guard to hand over to youngsters . Spain won the European Championships for a second time in a row in 2012 before their World Cup failure . Spain's Under 21s celebrate winning Euro 2013 and their brilliant young players are thriving right now . Nevertheless, the current Champions League quarter-finals are beginning to say something quite interesting about Spain's 'relevo'. If you don't speak Spanish, that term might mean very little to you. But I bet you can intuit. 'Relevo' in this context is like 'relief' — as in the armed forces term for the relief watch. Those who are sent in, fresh and ready, to relieve whichever servicemen or women who have born the brunt of service for the previous day or days. Xavi, Carles Puyol, Xabi Alonso, Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila have done their hard miles and it is not clear what toll battle has taken on Victor Valdes, David Villa and Fernando Torres. The natural place to look for fresh, young, well-drilled recruits ready to take on the world is in the Academy graduates. So let's go there. What caught my attention is that Juan Bernat's arrival to the Champions League quarter-final for Bayern Munich at Porto last Wednesday earned Valencia a seven-figure sum as part of the incentives associated with the full back's move to Bavaria. In other words, Bernat was one of those guys, just turned 22, that both Valencia and Bayern thought might be playing 'starting' football at this elite stage of the world's most demanding soccer tournament — but, equally, he might not. The likes of Xavi (right), Barcelona's midfield metronome, have done their hard miles and can now hand over . it is not clear what toll battle has taken on striker Fernando Torres, who now plays for Atletico Madrid . This is the season when he's broken into Vicente del Bosque's senior team, scoring, and formed part of a quite remarkable chain of left backs at the Mestalla — from Jordi Alba, European Champion with Spain in 2012, now at Barcelona, through Bernat to Jose Luis Gaya, a remarkable talent who is currently locked in stalled contract talks at Valencia while Madrid stalk his availability. And if you just look a little more closely then the eight teams left to sort the wheat from the chaff this week show evidence that, beyond Bernat, Spain still have a golden harvest to bring in. For example, take a snapshot of the penultimate trophy Spain won — not Euro 2012 but Under 21 Euro 2013, beating Italy 4-2. In that final they lined up: David de Gea; Martin Montoya, Inigo Martinez, Marc Bartra, Alberto Moreno; Koke, Thiago, Asier Illarramendi; Cristian Tello, Álvaro Morata, Isco. Juan Bernat (right) played in the Champions League and is the latest in a string of thriving Spaniards . David de Gea (right) has been in fine form for Manchester United and is a real goalkeeping talent for Spain . Of Spain U21's starting line-up at the 2013 Euros, only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season . Of that starting line-up only De Gea hasn't played UEFA football this season, eight of them are still in the Champions League quarter-finals while two of the substitutes, Nacho and Dani Carvajal have decent minutes in the competition. Throw in the fact that Spain's winning Under 21s coach was Julen Lopetegui, 3-1 up on Pep Guardiola's Bayern going into the second leg this week, and the progression from youth-level international football to full-fledged senior winner is going along very nicely. The eight starters and two substitutes from that 4-2 win are all now in the age range of 23 to just having turned 25. Between them they have 184 appearances in UEFA club matches — the vast majority of which are in the Champions League. Koke has played in the Final, Isco, Morata, Carvajal, Nacho and Illarramendi have won it, while Bartra and Thiago have played in a winning campaign. And it is important to throw in the fact that in last week's quarters, 20-year-old Oliver Torres (13 UEFA club matches) stood out against Bayern for Porto (he belongs to Atlético), while on the bench for the Madrid derby were fellow 20-year-olds Jese and Saul Nguez, who have 18 UEFA appearances between them. Spanish fans didn't quite know the great team they were getting in 2008, they could have another one now . Alvaro Morata (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Germany at Euro 2013 in Israel . Whether they flower for club and country or bloom early but fail to excel like recent Spanish generations have proven to do, the fact remains that there is a wave of fresh, exciting Spanish talents who demand attention now. This week in fact. Lopetegui, whose result probably constitutes one of the performances of the season, has a firm view. 'I don't think there's strictly a \"Spanish school\" of coaching or playing,' he argued earlier this season. 'There's just \"training\" and \"playing\". So what I' ve always looked for are kids who know how to understand the game. I think it's a common misconception that players completely understand football and how it's played. Former Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui has managed Porto to one of the results of the season in midweek . 'Understanding precisely what's going on in a game is not at all easy. 'The key is knowing what to do with the ball so that you don't lose possession and get caught disorganised. Never gift away space to an opponent. 'When you control the ball and space on the pitch, then you must know how to take advantage. But the line is thin, you want to make the players effective and efficient but never to kill off their creativity and capacity for invention.'", "reference_summary": "When Spain first became a real power, their own fans didn't know at first .

Dedicated: Churchill Downs is inviting John Sutton Jr, 84, to attend the Kentucky Derby as their special guest on May 2, since he has attended every race for the past 76 years . Winner, winner: Sutton was just 8 years old in 1940 when his father brought him to his first race, and the two bet against the favorite on a horse called Gallahadion, which ended up winning the race . Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race . Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport. Living history: Sutton has collected a program from every Kentucky Derby he has attended and keeps them in a binder at home. Above, some of the early years . Through the years: The Derby programs got more and more colorful over the years . Keepsakes: In addition to programs, Sutton has Kentucky Derby glasses stretching back more than seven decades . Autographs: Sutton got jockeys to sign several of his programs, which he proudly displays in frames at home . Entry: Above, some of the tickets Sutton has collected from the Kentucky Derby since 1940 . An eye for champions: Sutton won $600 dollars in 19567, when he bet on the winning horse Proud Clarion. Proud Clarion and jockey Bobby Ussery pictured above after placing first at Churchill Downs . Every year since then, Sutton has attended the Kentucky Derby and has collected each year's program since then, which he keeps in a binder at home. He also has kept a collection of his tickets, Derby glasses from the more than seven decades he has attended the race as well as pins and and other programs signed by jockeys. In his early years attending the Derby, Sutton says the day involved a bit of hard work going around to each betting window to buy tickets for his parents, and picking them up snacks for the main event on the way back. But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return.

Among the masses: Above, a view of the crowds at Churchill Downs on the day of the 1940 race . Sutton says he was just 8 years old in 1940 when his blacksmith father brought him to his first Kentucky Derby. 'Once the race started, we would crash the gates, so to speak to get on the rail or wherever we could get,' Sutton recalled. That year, Sutton and his father decided to bet on the horse Gallahadion, instead of the favorite, Bimelech. And to their delight, Gallahadion pulled through to an unexpected victory that helped cement Sutton's love for the sport. Living history: Sutton has collected a program from every Kentucky Derby he has attended and keeps them in a binder at home. Above, some of the early years . Through the years: The Derby programs got more and more colorful over the years . Keepsakes: In addition to programs, Sutton has Kentucky Derby glasses stretching back more than seven decades . Autographs: Sutton got jockeys to sign several of his programs, which he proudly displays in frames at home . Entry: Above, some of the tickets Sutton has collected from the Kentucky Derby since 1940 . An eye for champions: Sutton won $600 dollars in 19567, when he bet on the winning horse Proud Clarion. Proud Clarion and jockey Bobby Ussery pictured above after placing first at Churchill Downs . Every year since then, Sutton has attended the Kentucky Derby and has collected each year's program since then, which he keeps in a binder at home. He also has kept a collection of his tickets, Derby glasses from the more than seven decades he has attended the race as well as pins and and other programs signed by jockeys. In his early years attending the Derby, Sutton says the day involved a bit of hard work going around to each betting window to buy tickets for his parents, and picking them up snacks for the main event on the way back. But he continues to come back year after year, placing his bets by averaging the past performances of the horses competing. That method won him one of his biggest prizes in 1967, when the then 35-year-old Sutton placed his money on winning horse Proud Clarion and got $600 in return.

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different. With Daniel there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’", "reference_summary": "Jordon Ibe to put pen to paper on a new long-term deal at Liverpool .

The Jackson County jury found Susan Monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart, then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm, The Medford Mail Tribune reported. Circuit Judge Tim Barnack immediately sentenced 66-year-old Monica to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after a minimum of 50 years. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Susan Monica was found guilty on Tuesday of murdering two handymen on her pig farm over a one-year span. She was sentenced to a minimum of 50 years in prison. Pictured above in court on Tuesday . Floored: Monica and her defense team react to hearing a guilty verdict in court on Tuesday . 'You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,' the judge told Monica. 'I don't know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. 'It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer,' Barnack said. Prosecutors said Stephen Delicino, 59, was killed in 2012 and Robert Haney, 56, died in 2013. Monica asked for sentencing as soon as the jury was dismissed, saying 'it doesn't seem to matter.' The case will be appealed, the defense said. Victim: Robert Haney (pictured) is one of the two men Monica was found guilty of killing. She admitted to shooting Haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013, but jurors didn't buy the story . Monica's changing stories about how she shot Delicino and Haney never matched the forensic evidence, Allan Smith, senior assistant deputy district attorney, told jurors in closing arguments. She variously claimed that Delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self-defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20-acre farm in southern Oregon, Smith reminded jurors. Monica told investigators Haney disappeared in the summer of 2013. She said she came on him a month later as pigs were disemboweling him, and she shot him to ease his suffering. She later questioned whether he was alive when she shot him. Defense attorney Garren Pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut Monica's claims that she shot Delicino in self-defense or to show that Haney was actually alive when Monica shot him. Some of his remains were found in plastic bags in her barn. A State Police forensic anthropologist, Veronica Vance, testified that Haney's legs had been chopped off with an ax, and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal. Vance said she couldn't determine whether the ax blows came before or after Haney died. She said Delicino suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head, but there was no evidence one way or another about the self-defense claim. 'Just because Susan Monica is different and strange and weird doesn't make her a murderer,' another defense lawyer, Christine Herbert, told the jury. Gruesome discovery: The remains of the two handymen were found on Monica's farm after investigators noticed she was using one of the men's food stamps . Quick: It took a jury just an hour to come to the decision to convict Monica of murder. Pictured above in court on April 14 . Changing hair: Monica wore a short wig throughout the proceedings. Pictured above in two mugshots, one wearing a long wig and the other bald . At one point during the six-day trial, Monica herself cross-examined sheriff's Detective Eric Henderson, who was the lead investigator in the case, despite having her own defense team. On Monday, a cellmate of Monica's testified the defendant signed a birthday card in jail with this phrase: 'from the sweetest murderer in Jackson County.' 'I got chills from the birthday card,' 23-year-old inmate Jordan 'Janae' Farris testified. Farris was serving time for violating probation from a burglary conviction and met Monica in the Jackson County Jail. Monica said she signed the card in accordance with the charges she was facing, KDRV-TV reported. As the judge addressed the jury before deliberations Tuesday, the newspaper reported that Monica stood up, raised her hand and began asking for the chance to give jurors one more demonstration on how she claimed she shot Delicino. 'I'd like to demonstrate how I shot him for 10 seconds,' Monica said. Barnack initially ignored her. Then Monica put her hands in the air, as she did in her earlier testimony from the stand, and said, 'I held the gun like this.' At that, the judge ordered her back to jail and sheriff's deputies took her away.", "reference_summary": "It took jurors just an hour to convict Susan Monica on the murder charges on Tuesday .

The Jackson County jury found Susan Monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart, then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm, The Medford Mail Tribune reported.

'You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,' the judge told Monica. 'I don't know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. 'It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer,' Barnack said. Prosecutors said Stephen Delicino, 59, was killed in 2012 and Robert Haney, 56, died in 2013. Monica asked for sentencing as soon as the jury was dismissed, saying 'it doesn't seem to matter.' The case will be appealed, the defense said. Victim: Robert Haney (pictured) is one of the two men Monica was found guilty of killing. She admitted to shooting Haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013, but jurors didn't buy the story . Monica's changing stories about how she shot Delicino and Haney never matched the forensic evidence, Allan Smith, senior assistant deputy district attorney, told jurors in closing arguments. She variously claimed that Delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self-defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20-acre farm in southern Oregon, Smith reminded jurors. Monica told investigators Haney disappeared in the summer of 2013. She said she came on him a month later as pigs were disemboweling him, and she shot him to ease his suffering. She later questioned whether he was alive when she shot him. Defense attorney Garren Pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut Monica's claims that she shot Delicino in self-defense or to show that Haney was actually alive when Monica shot him. Some of his remains were found in plastic bags in her barn. A State Police forensic anthropologist, Veronica Vance, testified that Haney's legs had been chopped off with an ax, and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal. Vance said she couldn't determine whether the ax blows came before or after Haney died. She said Delicino suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head, but there was no evidence one way or another about the self-defense claim. 'Just because Susan Monica is different and strange and weird doesn't make her a murderer,' another defense lawyer, Christine Herbert, told the jury.

The Jackson County jury found Susan Monica guilty of murdering two men about a year apart, then abusing their corpses by feeding them to the animals at her farm, The Medford Mail Tribune reported. Circuit Judge Tim Barnack immediately sentenced 66-year-old Monica to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after a minimum of 50 years. Scroll down for video .

'You shot two people and fed them to your pigs,' the judge told Monica. 'I don't know how else I can put it. You valued pigs more than you value people. 'It may sound harsh, but you are a cold-blooded killer,' Barnack said. Prosecutors said Stephen Delicino, 59, was killed in 2012 and Robert Haney, 56, died in 2013. Monica asked for sentencing as soon as the jury was dismissed, saying 'it doesn't seem to matter.' The case will be appealed, the defense said. Victim: Robert Haney (pictured) is one of the two men Monica was found guilty of killing. She admitted to shooting Haney when she found him being attacked by her pigs in 2013, but jurors didn't buy the story . Monica's changing stories about how she shot Delicino and Haney never matched the forensic evidence, Allan Smith, senior assistant deputy district attorney, told jurors in closing arguments. She variously claimed that Delicino shot himself repeatedly in the head and also that she shot him in self-defense and he was eaten by her pigs before she buried his remains on her 20-acre farm in southern Oregon, Smith reminded jurors. Monica told investigators Haney disappeared in the summer of 2013. She said she came on him a month later as pigs were disemboweling him, and she shot him to ease his suffering. She later questioned whether he was alive when she shot him. Defense attorney Garren Pedemonte argued there was no concrete evidence to rebut Monica's claims that she shot Delicino in self-defense or to show that Haney was actually alive when Monica shot him. Some of his remains were found in plastic bags in her barn. A State Police forensic anthropologist, Veronica Vance, testified that Haney's legs had been chopped off with an ax, and the thigh bones showed signs of being gnawed by an animal. Vance said she couldn't determine whether the ax blows came before or after Haney died. She said Delicino suffered three to four gunshot wounds to the head, but there was no evidence one way or another about the self-defense claim. 'Just because Susan Monica is different and strange and weird doesn't make her a murderer,' another defense lawyer, Christine Herbert, told the jury. Gruesome discovery: The remains of the two handymen were found on Monica's farm after investigators noticed she was using one of the men's food stamps .

At one point during the six-day trial, Monica herself cross-examined sheriff's Detective Eric Henderson, who was the lead investigator in the case, despite having her own defense team.

Two mothers have slammed police for failing to act after their daughters were targeted by an online predator. Both Lesley Conman and Kerry Green's young daughters were sent sexualised messages by an online pervert on Facebook - but police refused to investigate as no offence had been committed. Ms Conman's daughter Abbie, 12, was sent a message by the man after accepting a friend request from someone pretending to be a 17-year-old boy. After the horrified mother saw the provocative messages, she challenged the man herself, pretending to be Abbie. Ms Conman, 34, from Hull, said: 'There were four or five messages that he sent, before he actually blocked me. I think I scared him. 'You can only find my daughter on Facebook if you have a mutual friend and this guy was friends with 100 of her school friends, so she thought he was from school.' After tackling the pervert, Lesley posted the messages on her own account to warn other parents of the dangerous predator. She said: 'I shared it because I would say 90 per cent of my daughter's school were on his profile and he was talking to her friends and his profile had about 300-400 friends and they were all under 15.' In the case of Ms Green's daughter Emily, 13, the sick man threatened to post explicit pictures on her Facebook wall - which all of her friends would have then seen - if she did not play along with his sordid messages. The pictures were not of Emily, but it is thought that he planned to post them online as if they were her.

This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at Liverpool. 'Of course, it will be the job of, in particular, his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that. 'The only thing I will say is that he has two-and-a-half years left, he won't be going anywhere in the summer. That's for sure. 'They will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.' Liverpool boss Rodgers believes Sterling can fulfill his potential at Anfield over the next few years . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was also asked about Sterling in the post-match press conference, but preferred to focus on his side's fine display. Impressive goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half-time lead. Jordan Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit, but Olivier Giroud added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after Emre Can saw red. 'You always have imperfections in any game but I feel we started with a great intensity, which is what we wanted to put them under pressure,' Wenger said . 'We created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances. Liverpool are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . 'We had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half. 'In fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third. 'The second half was more down to, can we maintain the discipline, intensity and not allow them to come back early? We did that. 'We had many chances on the break that I've seen again but in the end it was 4-1 which is very convincing in a very important game.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was pleased with the 'killer instinct' his side showed against Liverpool .", "reference_summary": "Arsenal beat Liverpool 4-1 in their Premier League encounter on Saturday .

This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at Liverpool. 'Of course, it will be the job of, in particular, his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that. 'The only thing I will say is that he has two-and-a-half years left, he won't be going anywhere in the summer. That's for sure. 'They will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.' Liverpool boss Rodgers believes Sterling can fulfill his potential at Anfield over the next few years . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was also asked about Sterling in the post-match press conference, but preferred to focus on his side's fine display. Impressive goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half-time lead. Jordan Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit, but Olivier Giroud added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after Emre Can saw red. 'You always have imperfections in any game but I feel we started with a great intensity, which is what we wanted to put them under pressure,' Wenger said . 'We created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances. Liverpool are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . 'We had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half. 'In fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third. 'The second half was more down to, can we maintain the discipline, intensity and not allow them to come back early? We did that. 'We had many chances on the break that I've seen again but in the end it was 4-1 which is very convincing in a very important game.'

This has been an uncomfortable week on Merseyside after the England forward's ill-advised interview only heightened speculation over his future. Sterling told the BBC that he turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal but insisted he was not a 'money-grabbing 20-year-old', while also admitting that links to Saturday's opponents Arsenal were 'quite flattering'. Raheem Sterling will still be a Liverpool player next season, insists Reds boss Brendan Rodgers . Sterling (left) started Liverpool's 4-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday despite going public over his club contract . Rodgers spoke to the forward about the week's events yet still started him at the Emirates Stadium, where the Gunners all but ended Liverpool's hopes of a top-four finish with a comfortable 4-1 win. 'The reaction and commitment of the players has been first class since (the defeat to Crystal Palace in November),' Rodgers said. 'Really, up until the Manchester United game we were the form team and playing very, very well. 'But we have been dealt two big blows in these last two games, we haven't performed how we would like and that has ultimately cost us in terms of the result. 'I very much doubt we will be in the top four now come the end of the season. There's too much ground to make up - that's the realistic view from me. 'Now, we must really focus on the FA Cup and that has got to be very, very important for us.' The 20-year-old (right) has turned down a new £100,000-a-week deal and put off talks until the summer . Liverpool take on Blackburn in a replay of their FA Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, when talk about Sterling will no doubt still be dominating the headlines. Rodgers is only interested on what is happening with the forward on the field, though, and wants another impressive performance from the England international at Ewood Park. 'There was no change in him,' he said of Sterling. 'I thought he was excellent today, our best player. 'He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, won the penalty and was very direct and strong, so I thought he was excellent today.' Rodgers was peppered with questions about Sterling in the post-match press conference, during which he said 'a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him'. Sterling (top) did win the visitors' penalty after he was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . The Liverpool manager was coy when asked about outside influences destabilising both club and player, but was forthright when it came to the forward's future. 'At 20 years of age - and just turned 20 in December - there is still a long way for him to go,' said Rodgers, who confirmed Mario Balotelli deemed himself unfit to travel after receiving a knock in training. 'He has got a lot of potential. I believe that potential he can really develop over these next few years at Liverpool. 'Of course, it will be the job of, in particular, his advisors to look at maybe what possibilities might be beyond that. 'The only thing I will say is that he has two-and-a-half years left, he won't be going anywhere in the summer. That's for sure. 'They will sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.' Liverpool boss Rodgers believes Sterling can fulfill his potential at Anfield over the next few years . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was also asked about Sterling in the post-match press conference, but preferred to focus on his side's fine display. Impressive goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez in quick succession gave the hosts a comfortable half-time lead. Jordan Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit, but Olivier Giroud added extra gloss in this seventh straight league win after Emre Can saw red. 'You always have imperfections in any game but I feel we started with a great intensity, which is what we wanted to put them under pressure,' Wenger said . 'We created some early chances after and then when we relieved the pressure they had one or two chances. Liverpool are a good side going forwards and they always look dangerous. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . 'We had a killing instinct and took advantage of our strong moments in the first half. 'In fairness we played at a good pace and had some good combination game in the final third. 'The second half was more down to, can we maintain the discipline, intensity and not allow them to come back early? We did that. 'We had many chances on the break that I've seen again but in the end it was 4-1 which is very convincing in a very important game.'

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. Johnson said he had no figure for the value of what was stolen. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds, or 300 million dollars, in a remark widely reported by news media. And numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. But Johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving them in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be the same as the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. Johnson said he had no figure for the value of what was stolen. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to 200 million pounds, or 300 million dollars, in a remark widely reported by news media. And numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. But Johnson said police were still identifying the owners of the ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving them in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. Over the four-day Easter holiday, an unknown number of thieves broke into the vault and might have been able to take as much as four days to rifle through the boxes. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the UK capable of having pulled it off. He said had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country.

But for one woman, securing a job at the Pokemon Centre in Japan would be her dream come true. Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia of all shapes and sizes. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia . Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme helped her through a very difficult stage of her life . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now.

But for one woman, securing a job at the Pokemon Centre in Japan would be her dream come true. Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia of all shapes and sizes. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia . Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life. For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme helped her through a very difficult stage of her life . 'I started collecting when I was getting bullied at school, Pokemon was the only thing that made me feel happy.' Sharon Courtney said she did not mind moving to a smaller bedroom as Pokemon was so important to her daughter. 'I love Pokemon now. It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for £60 online. 'I will always collect Pokemon, here's always something new to get. 'For me, Pokemon is like an additional family - it always lifts my spirits.'

The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991, and that the pair were 'inseparable' growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991, and that the pair were 'inseparable' growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

Carl, 44, encouraged singletons to embrace their failed relationships because not everyone is going to be 'the one'. 'The goal of relationships is for them to end in marriage, but 99per cent of the relationships you have won’t end in marriage, and that's not a bad thing - even if you don’t know it yet,' he said. Meanwhile, Daniel, 27, insisted that couples need to be 'equally yoked' when it comes to their career, ambitions and education in order for the relationships to be a success. But the most interesting piece of advice came from Musaf, who recalled how his parents met at the altar. According to the 33-year-old cab driver, young people - including fickle New Yorkers - have a fear of commitment because they have 'too many options'.

With that in mind, New York-based writer Danielle Page set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice in hopes unlocking the key to a successful union. The drivers, many of whom are married themselves, revealed their personal tips, life lessons and cultural anecdotes all in the name of love, which Danielle then shared on YourTango. A 60-year-old named Michael revealed that his trick to marital bliss is putting his wife's happiness above his own – but insists that what really makes a relationship work is finding a partner who will do the same for you. Looking for answers: New York-based writer Danielle Page (not pictured) set out to ask every cabbie she came across to dispense their best piece of relationship advice . 'Always think of what’s best for the other person. If you’re always thinking, \"How can I make the other person happy?\" the other person wants to do the same for you,' he told Danielle. Sharif, 32, said that honesty is the key lasting love - even if that means telling your girlfriend that she looks fat in her jeans. Another driver firmly believes that people should allow their partners to change, and a part of that process is choosing to love the person they've become. 'In order to have a lasting relationship, you need to choose the new version of what your partner becomes and accept their new interests,' 49-year-old Alex told Danielle. 'If you can’t do that, you’re screwed.' A Muslim driver named Asaf, 38, explained that his religion forbids having 'girlfriends on the side' is strictly forbidden – suggesting that this rule is one of a number of reasons why his marriage has lasted for 13 years. And while many people might scoff at the idea of ending their friendships with members of the opposite sex because they have entered a relationship, many of the cab drivers are in agreement that it is important to always be respectful of your partner’s feelings. When giving their advice, other cab drivers focused on what people should doing when they are trying to find a date.

Tuition, sporting and curricula fees for Scot's College, one of Sydney's most prestigious schools, reportedly top $30,000 . The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot's College to skip their year 12 exams and 'buy' their entry into the sandstone university. 'Access to university should be fair and equitable,' Mr Piccoli told Fairfax Media. 'Any scheme that gives some students an unfair advantage is unacceptable and I will be discussing this with the federal government, which is responsible for universities.' Eight Scot's students gained 'direct entry' to the university after completing the program in 2014, according to a letter sent to parents by principal Dr Ian Lambert, while 166 students completed the HSC. The program was devised by the university's commercial arm, Sydney Learning, and students who completed the course successfully were guaranteed places in a number of undergraduate level courses, including bachelor degrees in health sciences, liberal arts and science, animal and veterinary bioscience, visual arts, music and oral health, or in a diploma of law. Opposition leader Luke Foley is concerned over how this alternative would impact the HSC. 'We have a federal Coalition government intent on linking university admission to wealth, more and more, and these are the sorts of arrangements that flow from the Abbott government's reform of our higher education sector,' he said. The Sydney Morning Herald have reported that concern within the University of Sydney staff has led to its academic board shutting down this alternative pathway for school students.

My Foley is worried that this pathway will be picked up by other universities and elite high schools. Scot's College does not advertise their fees for tuition, sport and other curriculum activities, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 per year with an extra $24,121 for boarders. Scot's College: Dr Lambert, the college's chief, was quoted telling the Sydney Morning Herald that the diploma was designed with students 'in the middle rank of learners' in mind . Rose Steele, the president of the National Union of Students, told Daily Mail Australia that while it was important there were alternative pathways available for students to gain entry to university, it was 'really concerning' if this program was only open to students who could afford it. 'NUS really believes education should be open to all and not just those who can afford it,' Ms Steele said. Daily Mail Australia approached the University of Sydney and Scot's College for comment on Monday morning. Principal Ian Lambert has rejected the notion that it was an exclusive deal for Scot's College.

The White House said Tuesday that Nye, who has degrees in engineering but was made famous by his 90s era television show for school children, 'Bill Nye the Science Guy,' would make the trek today on its behalf to shoot a video of the president. On the road trip from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to the Florida swamp and back again, a 1,836 mile flight, Nye will have ample opportunity to take a big whiff of the carbon being emitted from the president's jet as it burns up more than 9,180 gallons of fuel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Television personality and author Bill Nye 'the Science Guy' joined President Barack Obama today for an Earth Day excursion, riding aboard Air Force One with the president during his visit to the Florida Everglades. Nye held court with press before boarding the airliner, telling them that he loves the smell of jet fuel . Global warming triumverate Barack Obama (center) Bill Nye (left) and Neil DeGrasse Tyson (right) shared a selfie moment in the Blue Room of the White House last year . Off to save the planet: Obama flew nearly 2,000 miles round-trip on Earth Day to the Florida Everglades and back . Nye told press it was his first time on the president's private jet, but he once rode AF2 with former Vice President Al Gore. And, while he was working as an engineer at Boeing in 1978, Nye said he designed an anti-vibration tube for the horizontal stabilizer that is used in the company's 747 planes, and likely AF1. In a tweet last night, Nye said he was 'heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One with President Obama. 'We're going to '#ActonClimate,' he wrote. 'That said, the excitement, much like #climatechange, is real,' he added in a follow-up tweet a minute later. The statements were met with puzzled responses. 'Doesn't jet travel leave a big carbon footprint?' user Timothy Grome wrote. 'Hmm, seems ironic. doesn't seem very climate friendly earth day,' Allison B. of Galveston, Texas, said. White House communications director Jen Psaki got some 'cool points' today by posing for a selfie with Nye . Obama used the Earth Day trip to promote his administration's commitment to cutting carbon pollution and preserving Florida's wetlands, taking a tour of Everglades National Park and giving a speech that was first cancelled this morning for the public because of heavy showers, then rescheduled. 'I can’t think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation’s greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he’s looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly. The White House's official photographer, Pete Souza, posted this image to Instagram today with the following caption: 'It's @billnye (The Science Guy) on Marine One talking science on Earth Day with the President, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz' 'I can say as a general matter that the Department of Defense has acknowledged that climate change does pose a national security threat to the United States,' Earnest added. 'And there are a lot of practices that the Department of Defense has taken to try to reduce their carbon footprint.' Knoller, the unofficial historian of the modern White House, also frequently calculates how much fuel AF1 guzzles up – including during today's trip. Florida's Republican governor Rick Scott lit into Obama and Congress in anticipation of the president's visit. He accused them of not providing his state with what he believes to be appropriate financial resources to protect the Everglades .

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS .

Global warming triumverate Barack Obama (center) Bill Nye (left) and Neil DeGrasse Tyson (right) shared a selfie moment in the Blue Room of the White House last year . Off to save the planet: Obama flew nearly 2,000 miles round-trip on Earth Day to the Florida Everglades and back . Nye told press it was his first time on the president's private jet, but he once rode AF2 with former Vice President Al Gore. And, while he was working as an engineer at Boeing in 1978, Nye said he designed an anti-vibration tube for the horizontal stabilizer that is used in the company's 747 planes, and likely AF1. In a tweet last night, Nye said he was 'heading down to DC to catch an #EarthDay flight on Air Force One with President Obama. 'We're going to '#ActonClimate,' he wrote. 'That said, the excitement, much like #climatechange, is real,' he added in a follow-up tweet a minute later. The statements were met with puzzled responses. 'Doesn't jet travel leave a big carbon footprint?' user Timothy Grome wrote. 'Hmm, seems ironic. doesn't seem very climate friendly earth day,' Allison B. of Galveston, Texas, said. White House communications director Jen Psaki got some 'cool points' today by posing for a selfie with Nye . Obama used the Earth Day trip to promote his administration's commitment to cutting carbon pollution and preserving Florida's wetlands, taking a tour of Everglades National Park and giving a speech that was first cancelled this morning for the public because of heavy showers, then rescheduled. 'I can’t think of a better way to spend Earth Day than in one of our nation’s greatest natural treasures, the Everglades,' he told his audience, calling the swamp, which he acknowledged is not technically a swamp, 'magical.' Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he’s looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly. The White House's official photographer, Pete Souza, posted this image to Instagram today with the following caption: 'It's @billnye (The Science Guy) on Marine One talking science on Earth Day with the President, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz' 'I can say as a general matter that the Department of Defense has acknowledged that climate change does pose a national security threat to the United States,' Earnest added.

Knoller, the unofficial historian of the modern White House, also frequently calculates how much fuel AF1 guzzles up – including during today's trip.

Asked on Monday if the president risks 'undermining' his message on greenhouse gases by adding to emissions with his own travel, Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said ,'no, he doesn't' and repeated the administration's talking points on the harmful effects of carbon pollution. 'That is precisely the case that the President will be making at the Everglades. And he’s looking forward to the trip,' Earnest concluded. He then directed the reporter, CBS News' Mark Knoller, to the Department of Defense and the Presidential Airlift Group for information on what the United States Air Force is doing to make the president's travel more environmentally friendly.

One such creature can be seen at the centre of this illustration. They lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food.

The latest research was conducted by Dr Elena Temereva from the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric - we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right. However, our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not, with many of them thought to be worm-like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor. A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures.

Organisms that lived in the sea 635 to 541 million years ago, from which humans and other animals evolved, likely had flexible appendages and a complex nervous system. It seemingly puts to bed another theory that suggests our ancestors were much more simple, worm-like creatures. A Russian scientist says the distant ancestor of humans had tentacles. One such creature can be seen at the centre of this illustration. They lived more than 540 million years ago and used them for food. It's likely they also had a complex nervous system like we do today . The latest research was conducted by Dr Elena Temereva from the Department of Invertebrate Zoology at the Faculty of Biology of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric - we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right. However, our distant ancestors hundreds of millions ago were not, with many of them thought to be worm-like creatures that swam in the seas or walked on the seafloor. A warming climate may have enabled the earliest humans to venture into Western Europe 1.4 million years ago, a new study suggests. Researchers believe that the spread of our distant human ancestors, the hominins, had been halted by colder and drier temperatures. But as conditions warmed, they were able to branch out from Africa into Spain, and ultimately spread across Europe. The research was led by Dr Jordi Agusti from the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA). How we evolved into bilateral creatures, and what we evolved from, has been a cause of some debate. One theory suggests that our common bilaterian ancestor was a worm without appendages and just a simple nervous system. Dr Temereva’s research, though, favours a different theory. She says that our ancestors had appendages - or tentacles - that were used for movement and food collection. And, she says, they also had a complex nervous system. To come to her conclusion she studied Lingula anatina, an ancient brachiopod found all over the world. Lingula is one of the oldest brachiopods having survived to the present day, originating in the Early Ordovician era 500 million years ago. For that reason, and as it has hardly changed over geological time, it is often referred to as a ‘living fossil’ of organisms in the distant past. Today, humans and many other organisms are bilaterally symmetric; we have a clearly discernible top and bottom, and a left and a right - such as depicted in da Vinci's The Vitruvian Man, shown left.

The first ever drawing of The Beatles' famous Yellow Submarine which is dubbed the 'holy grail of memorabilia' is set to fetch more than £10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas, Texas, on Thursday . The rare celluloid painting, known as a cel, was used as a master version from which artists working on the Yellow Submarine film created all other images of the wacky vessel. The 1968 film starred The Beatles (above) It features handwritten notes instructing artists on the correct colours to use when recreating the submarine. More than 240 artists and animators worked full time for an entire year to produce the film using revolutionary techniques, and it is credited with helping boost the popularity of animation. Yellow Submarine was a critical success on its release and led onto The Beatles' 10th studio album the following year. The single Yellow Submarine, written by Paul McCartney and sung by Ringo Starr, had featured on the 1967 album Revolver and spent four weeks at the top of the UK charts. Original examples of cels from Yellow Submarine are so sought after that experts have tipped the submarine cartoon to fetch £10,000 when it goes under the hammer on Thursday. Jim Lentz, director of animation art at Heritage Auctions which is hosting the sale in Dallas, Texas, said: 'Yellow Submarine is one of the most important animations of all time.

The most expensive animation celluloid, known as cel, to be sold in the world is The Band Concert by Disney. The animation, which is noted as the first colour Mickey Mouse cartoon, was released in 1935. In the cartoon, Mickey is trying to lead a concert of the William Tell Overture, amid various distractions such as Donald Duck playing the wrong tune on his flute. The cel was sold in a private transaction in 1999 for a reported £280,000 ($420,000). 'The message of the film - all you need is love - is timeless. 'It is incredible to think the team behind the film put it together in only a year when at that time it would take up to four years to make a feature animation film. 'The animation was ground-breaking and that coupled with the fact that the film was all about the biggest band in the world is what made it so iconic. 'Amazingly, after the film was made the celluloid sheets were sold off in high street stores for as little as seven pounds. Now they are worth thousands.' 'This is a rare hand-painted colour model cel painted by the ink and paint department for cel and animation reference.

And now experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive 'hats' made of red stone on top of some of the figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago. They believe that the hats, or 'pukao', were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures which measure up to 40ft (12 metres) tall. Mystery solved? Experts believe they have finally discovered how the Rapa Nui people placed distinctive hats made of red stone on top of some of the Easter Island figures’ heads, more than 700 years ago . Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the University of Oregon, believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy. ‘It seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it, either by levering or rolling,’ he told the 80th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. This is despite the largest pukaos measuring six-and-a-half feet (two metres) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes (1,890 stone). Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents. A tall order: Physicists believe that the pukao, or 'hats,' were rolled up ramps to reach the top of the figures (examples are pictured left and right), some of which measure up to 40 ft (12 metres) tall . Remote: Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents . The Moai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island, between 1,250 and 1,500 AD.

Since Europeans came to Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, in the 1700s, people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected, complete with their 'hats'. Some experts believe the stones were walked into place, while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position, unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources. An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues, or scattered nearby. They are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been, with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems. Despite this, many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance. Mr Hixon’s team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a Moai’s head, using different techniques. These included rolling a ‘hat’ up a ramp, building a tower, using a pulley system and putting the ‘hat’ on the statue before raising the whole statue as one. They concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp.

Despite the size of the statues, Sean Hixon an undergraduate student in archaeology and geology at the University of Oregon, believes the rolling of the bulky stones would have been relatively easy. ‘It seems like a relatively small number of people could have done it, either by levering or rolling,’ he told the 80th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. This is despite the largest pukaos measuring six-and-a-half feet (two metres) in diameter and weighing 12 tonnes (1,890 stone). Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents.

Remote: Some 1,000 carved Moai line the perimeter of the 12 mile (25km) volcanic island, which is the most isolated inhabited landmass on Earth with just 6,000 residents . The Moai are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island, between 1,250 and 1,500 AD. All the figures have overly-large heads and are thought to be living faces of deified ancestors. The 887 statues gaze inland across the island with an average height of 13ft (four metres). All but 53 of the Moai were carved from tuff - compressed volcanic ash - and around 100 wear red pukao of scoria. In 1979 archaeologists said the statues were designed to hold coral eyes. The figures are believed to be symbol of authority and power. They may have embodied former chiefs and were repositories of spirits or 'mana'. They are positioned so that ancient ancestors watch over the villages, while seven look out to sea to help travellers find land. But it is a mystery as to how the vast carved stones were transported into position. The island is half the size of the Isle of Wight, or twice the size of Manhattan, and lies 2,236 miles (3,600km) west of the South American mainland. Since Europeans came to Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, in the 1700s, people have wondered how the vast carved stones were erected, complete with their 'hats'. Some experts believe the stones were walked into place, while others have suggested that locals chopped down trees to roll the statues into position, unwittingly destroying the forests and causing their own demise through lack of natural resources. An estimated 100 pukao have been discovered so far, either in place on the statues, or scattered nearby. They are made from red volcanic rock called scoria and experts are divided as to what they may have been, with suggestions ranging from hairstyles to turbans and diadems. Despite this, many agree that the red colour of the stone indicates that the pukao had ritual significance. Mr Hixon’s team used basic physics to model the force and torque required to place a pukao on a Moai’s head, using different techniques. These included rolling a ‘hat’ up a ramp, building a tower, using a pulley system and putting the ‘hat’ on the statue before raising the whole statue as one. They concluded that the rounded oblong shape of the pukao means that it would have required relatively little energy to roll them up a ramp.

This map shows the location of the 887 statues, which gaze inland across the island, with an average height of 13ft (four metres) It may have been possible for less than 10 men to roll a ‘hat’ into place, because the oblong shape stopped it easily rolling down the ramp again, but was still a good shape for being hauled upwards. Some of the statues have indentations which may have stopped them tipping over during placement of the pukao. And a number of the ‘hats also have vertical marks and ring-shaped indentations on their side, which may indicate that strips of wood were used to provide traction up the ramp. However, while the team thinks ramps were the most likely method for the placing of the hats, their models revealed that any of the proposed methods for raising the pukao would have been possible - with enough manpower. Erosion and damage have also scarred the sides of the pukao, meaning that analysis of marks and scratches is 'far from conclusive'. It is not known exactly how the vast Easter Island statues came to line the perimeter of the small island. But in 2013, scientists claimed they may have been walked into position. A team led by Archaeologists Carl Lipo from the University of California State University Long Beach, and Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii claimed the statues' bases were carved so they could lean forward to make them easier to transport.

But even by their standards, Mark-Francis Vandelli is well-to-do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model wouldn't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to. But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however - I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave. This is my hardwearing, \"I'm going to Shoreditch\" watch.'", "reference_summary": "Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches .

But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however - I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave.

Although her wealth has increased year-on-year, her assets have been dwarfed by hundreds of financiers and businessmen. Britain’s super-rich are now more than twice as rich as they were in 2009, despite the catastrophic economic crisis. Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday. She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of £340m, compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first time .

David and Simon Reubeb: £9.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £547billion, up from £258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent. Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £100million – £45million more than in 2009 and £15million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years. The findings are revealed in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have ‘strong links’ to this country. The Queen’s wealth grew modestly in the last year by £10million to £340million, leaving her at number 302 – down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with £5.2billion. However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth. Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of £267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant. Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual Vacancy . George Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790 . Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industry . Among the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September. Worth an estimated £121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats. Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to £240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M. The footballer, 39, is now one of the country’s leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise £7million for needy children in the next three years. Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by £140million to £1.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine Jenkins . Len Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year’s Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £13.17billion. The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up £3.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles’ label, to his growing number of interests. The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984. Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik’s share was more than £4billion. Access’s stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow. Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a £41million mansion in London’s Kensington, recently paid $77million (£50.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated £75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government.

Sri and Gopi Hinduja: £13billion (Industry and finance) 3. Galena and George Weston and family: £11billion (Retailing) 4. Alisher Usmanov: £9.8billion (Mining and investment) 5. David and Simon Reubeb: £9.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £547billion, up from £258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent. Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £100million – £45million more than in 2009 and £15million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years. The findings are revealed in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have ‘strong links’ to this country. The Queen’s wealth grew modestly in the last year by £10million to £340million, leaving her at number 302 – down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with £5.2billion. However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth. Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of £267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant. Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual Vacancy . George Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790 . Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industry . Among the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September. Worth an estimated £121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats. Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to £240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M. The footballer, 39, is now one of the country’s leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise £7million for needy children in the next three years. Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by £140million to £1.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine Jenkins . Len Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year’s Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £13.17billion. The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up £3.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles’ label, to his growing number of interests. The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984. Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik’s share was more than £4billion. Access’s stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow. Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a £41million mansion in London’s Kensington, recently paid $77million (£50.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated £75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government. Blavatnik’s ten quoted and private company stakes are worth £9billion. With £3billion of cash, £440million of property and other assets, he is worth £13.17billion. He may have just missed out on the top 100, but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year. The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his £1.04billion wealth. Lord Sugar, pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton, has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14 . He was described by The Sunday Times as ‘super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down’ on The Apprentice. The BBC show first ran in 2005, with winners including Leah Totton, who triumphed in 2013, securing Lord Sugar’s backing to open a cosmetic clinic. Lord Sugar has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14. There are now 117 sterling billionaires based in Britain, up 12 per cent on last year, but only 62 are British – including Sir Richard Branson, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir James Dyson. At the top of Britain’s cash pile is Ukraine-born Len Blavatnik, who has investments in music, industry and media, and is worth £13.17billion, up £3.17billion on 2014. A Briton on the average annual wage of £25,000 would need to work for 526,800 years to earn the same. At number two are India-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who have family interests in industry and global finance and are worth £13billion. The Anglo-Canadian Weston family, who own Primark as well as Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in London, are third with £11billion. David and Victoria Beckham, worth £240million . Ranked: . 154: Songwriter and former Bealte Sir Paul McCartney and wife Nancy Shevell, worth £730million . 172: Composer and musical theatre maestro Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber, worth £650million . 313: TV talent show creator and owner of SyCo music label Simon Cowell, worth £325million . 371: Musician and pianist Elton John, worth £270million . 410: Football and fashion due David and Victoria Beckham, worth £240million . 425: Rolling Stone Sir Mick Jagger, worth £225 million .

Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip. He also thinks Leicester’s sustained spell in the relegation zone has equipped them with the psychological tools to claw their way up. ‘If you know this situation at the bottom you play different, the mentality is a little different,’ he said. ‘Now with a good result and we have to push on.’ A Leicester fan holds up a sign backing the team to win their battle against relegation this season .", "reference_summary": "Leicester have recorded three consecutive Premier League wins .

Their 2-0 victory over Swansea made it three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000, lifting Nigel Pearson’s side to 17th and ending their five-month spell at the bottom. All this after just two wins in their previous 24 games. Most looking at the club reasoned relegation would be a matter of time. Instead, Queens Park Rangers, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland are now shorter odds to go down with bookmakers. In truth, there have been no significant changes to affect results. Pearson has applied the same principles throughout the season, except now Leicester are taking more chances. Here Sportsmail assesses the key themes of Leicester’s revival. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring against Swansea during his side's 2-0 win . Scoring surge . Andy King’s late tap-in meant Leicester have scored two or more goals in a fourth consecutive top-flight match for the first time since May 2000. Previously, Leicester were creating plenty but fluffing their lines. Against Crystal Palace in February, for example, they had five shots on target, eight shots off target, six shots blocked – and failed to find the net, losing 1-0. They had six shots on target against Swansea, with a much better success rate. Andy King scores Leicester's second goal to seal three points against Swansea at the King Power Stadium . Cambiasso class . Ulloa scored his first Premier League goal in 647 minutes; last scoring on Boxing Day 2014. Esteban Cambiasso will surely be named Leicester’s player of the season come what may. The Argentine has sprinkled high quality to their midfield, winning possession and conducting play like a grand master plots chess moves. At 34, his experience is now shining through – a calm head even as circumstances appeared brittle. His goal to set up the win over West Ham was special too. His pass completion was not outstanding against Swansea – just 68.3 per cent – but that is largely because he tried difficult balls to get his team on the front foot. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso puts in another classy performance against Swansea on Saturday . Schmeichel sensational . With the score at 1-0, Swansea unlocked the Leicester defence to send Nelson Oliveira through on goal. Kasper Schmeichel was out in a flash, spreading himself large and deflecting the finish wide. It was a hugely important moment. The Danish goalkeeper was on the sidelines with a broken metatarsal for more than three months of this season, but has returned at peak form for this crucial period. Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel gets down quickly and makes himself big to save from Nelson Oliveria . Adept at adapting . Aside from Schmeichel’s injury, Pearson has been able to call a mainly full-strength squad most weeks. He has changed personnel – only Wes Morgan has more than 30 starts under his belt – and players appear fresh when other squads may be tiring. He is flexible with his tactics, changing during games to suit the situation. He is getting it right recently. Against West Bromwich Albion he began with 4-3-1-2 but switched to 3-5-2 when trailing at half-time. Against Swansea, he started with an attacking 3-4-1-2 but implemented a back four when ahead. King slides in with a strong challenge on Swansea's Oliveria during the Premier League match on Saturday . Pearson’s strength . The Leicester manager has been on the touchline rather than high in the stands recently, and uses his position to effect rather than for show. He kept players motivated at the Hawthorns and used a break in play against Swansea to give an impromptu team talk. He has been in remarkable survivals before, at Carlisle, Southampton, and West Brom, and knows what is required. He has managed to keep the respect of the squad through his imposing personality even after the phantom sacking. The players have always supported him. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson gives instructions to his players ahead of the 2-0 win over Swansea . Belief building . The great escape theme was hummed loudly by Leicester fans at fullt-time, and atmospheres at the King Power Stadium have been very noisy for the wins over West Ham and Swansea. That will continue for four of the final six games, with home comfort looking vital. Burnley at Turf Moor awaits first, and Leonardo Ulloa, who scored the opening goal, insists Leicester must not let their intensity dip.

In what has been described as a 'confronting case of animal cruelty', these photos were released by RSPCA South Australia on Tuesday . The RSPCA seized the owner's cats in September and further requested to have them all surrendered in their care, The Advertiser reports. However the owner, who's identity has not been revealed, was granted to have two of his cats returned under the RSPCA's supervision. The animal welfare group will be caring and rehoming the third cat. The case was finalised in the Christies Beach Magistrates Court, southern Adelaide, on Tuesday. The owner was further ordered to pay $500 in compensation. RSPCA South Australia detailed how the cats at the property were in poor physical condition when they were seized in September . The pet owner pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to provide appropriate and adequate living conditions for his cats . The cats suffered from high-temperatures, flea-allergy dermatitis and significant respiratory issues when they were found at the property, according to the RSPCA. But this isn't an isolated case as the chief inspector of RSPCA South Australia, Andrea Lewis, told The Advertiser that in the past year they have received more than 1000 similar reports. 'Sadly, RSPCA inspectors and rescue officers are faced with conditions similar to those in this case on a regular basis,' Ms Lewis said. 'They work incredibly hard to remove animals from these conditions, and to provide them with the care they deserve.'

Statistics published by the BBC show there were an average of 10.7million daily requests overall and it was the best month ever for requests to television programmes, with an average of 8.6m requests a day. Live episodes of EastEnders and The Comic Relief Bake Off also featured in the top 20 programmes this month along with dramas such as Waterloo Road, Silent Witness, The Casual Vacancy and Wolf Hall. The four episodes in February were watched a total of 9,047,000 times while episode two alone was watched 2,645,000 times . Figures for March are expected to see a sharp decline, the Telegraph reports, since only two episodes of Top Gear were shown before Clarkson’s dramatic suspension. On Tuesday, the BBC confirmed Top Gear's £10million live world tour will go ahead with Jeremy Clarkson at the helm alongside fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said they will fulfil the series of live shows which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide - but added that the events will be stripped of all BBC branding and content and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take place in venues as far afield as Australia, Norway, and South Africa as well as the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig. Record: The long-running motoring show took up first, second, third and fifth spots in the catch-up service's top five for the month (file picture) The tour starts in Australia and fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets to the live shows. The BBC suspended Clarkson when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as 'a fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. Last Wednesday, BBC director-general Tony Hall announced that Clarkson, a popular but divisive figure during his time at the hugely successful BBC2 motoring show, would not be retained, saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Mr Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in a 30-second assault on March 4 and took himself to hospital with his injuries. He was also verbally abused by the former Top Gear presenter. Clarkson reported the incident to the BBC five days later and was suspended on March 10.

Now the corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs.

Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7 million, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine. The motoring programme was also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year.

According to the Daily Telegraph the four episodes in February were watched a total of 9,047,000 times while episode two alone was watched 2,645,000 times. The service received 299million requests for streaming or downloading television and radio programmes during the month. Statistics published by the BBC show there were an average of 10.7million daily requests overall and it was the best month ever for requests to television programmes, with an average of 8.6m requests a day. Live episodes of EastEnders and The Comic Relief Bake Off also featured in the top 20 programmes this month along with dramas such as Waterloo Road, Silent Witness, The Casual Vacancy and Wolf Hall. The four episodes in February were watched a total of 9,047,000 times while episode two alone was watched 2,645,000 times . Figures for March are expected to see a sharp decline, the Telegraph reports, since only two episodes of Top Gear were shown before Clarkson’s dramatic suspension. On Tuesday, the BBC confirmed Top Gear's £10million live world tour will go ahead with Jeremy Clarkson at the helm alongside fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said they will fulfil the series of live shows which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide - but added that the events will be stripped of all BBC branding and content and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take place in venues as far afield as Australia, Norway, and South Africa as well as the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig. Record: The long-running motoring show took up first, second, third and fifth spots in the catch-up service's top five for the month (file picture) The tour starts in Australia and fans have paid between £35 and £200 for tickets to the live shows. The BBC suspended Clarkson when it emerged he had been involved in what was initially described as 'a fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. Last Wednesday, BBC director-general Tony Hall announced that Clarkson, a popular but divisive figure during his time at the hugely successful BBC2 motoring show, would not be retained, saying 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Mr Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in a 30-second assault on March 4 and took himself to hospital with his injuries. He was also verbally abused by the former Top Gear presenter. Clarkson reported the incident to the BBC five days later and was suspended on March 10.

The BBC could lose as much as £67million a year now Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has been sacked. The star helped relaunch the ailing show in 2002, turning it into a worldwide hit. Now the corporation's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £50million a year from selling the rights to Top Gear overseas, with the show watched in 214 countries around the world. On top of that, BBC Worldwide makes millions more from Top Gear Magazine and live shows in the UK and abroad, as well as sales of DVDs. The BBC could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit after giving Clarkson his marching orders, with the sale of the show overseas making £50million alone. Top Gear Magazine has a global circulation of 1.7 million, bringing in another estimated £7.4million - not including profit from advertising, as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine. The motoring programme was also set to make around £7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the UK this year.

A pilot noticed a reflection off the Ford Explorer and landed the police helicopter on shore, finally ending the women's unexpected wilderness adventure. Leslie Roy, 52, and Lee Marie Wright, 56, were examined at a hospital and released. ‘It was sheer joy,’ Detective Sgt. Jeff Marker told The Associated Press, describing their reaction to the rescue. ‘It was almost disbelief that it was finally happening.’ Alive! Lee Wright (left), and Leslie Roy (right) are pictured eating and keeping warm in state police coats after they had spent two weeks stuck in their disabled SUV in Michigan . Roy, of Valley, Nebraska, and Wright of Depew, Oklahoma, got stuck about three miles from Crisp Point Lighthouse in Luce County in the Upper Peninsula. They had been visiting relatives in Ishpeming, in another part of the peninsula, and were planning to head south April 11. They had a reservation at a hotel in Mackinaw City but never showed up. Instead, they were entombed in snow on a remote used road with eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies purchased from relatives and a bag of cheese puffs, Marker said. ‘They thought the road was plowed but it wasn't,’ he said. There is no cellphone service in the area. The car eventually lost power, too. Roy and Wright wore layers of clothes to stay warm as overnight temperatures fell to the 20s, and they also turned snow into water. ‘They heard crunching in the woods at night,’ Marker said. ‘They thought it was rescuers but no one came. Then they thought it was bears.’ When the search began, police said the women had told others about possibly visiting waterfalls and casinos on their way to the Lower Peninsula. Their Ford Explorer was spotted from a helicopter around 2.30pm, police said. About 25 minutes later, police officers who were called to the scene reached the car on foot. 'When we pulled up, they grabbed their purses and Lee Wright clutched onto her Bible and both women were very happy,' Marker told MLive.com. 'It was hugs all around.' Road trip: Roy (left), 52, and Wright (right), 56, had been visiting relatives in Ishpeming, Michigan, when on April 11 their Ford Explorer got trapped in snow on a little-used road . Life savers: The women survived by rationing eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies, a bag of cheese puffs and melted snow . The women were transported to Helen Newberry Joy Hospital to be checked by doctors. A photo of Roy and Wright showed them eating food and keeping warm in state police coats after the rescue. ‘They're walking. ... They're alive and well, just a little weak from being stuck for a couple weeks,’ said Sgt. Brent Rosten, of the Michigan State Police.

A pilot noticed a reflection off the Ford Explorer and landed the police helicopter on shore, finally ending the women's unexpected wilderness adventure. Leslie Roy, 52, and Lee Marie Wright, 56, were examined at a hospital and released. ‘It was sheer joy,’ Detective Sgt. Jeff Marker told The Associated Press, describing their reaction to the rescue. ‘It was almost disbelief that it was finally happening.’ Alive! Lee Wright (left), and Leslie Roy (right) are pictured eating and keeping warm in state police coats after they had spent two weeks stuck in their disabled SUV in Michigan . Roy, of Valley, Nebraska, and Wright of Depew, Oklahoma, got stuck about three miles from Crisp Point Lighthouse in Luce County in the Upper Peninsula. They had been visiting relatives in Ishpeming, in another part of the peninsula, and were planning to head south April 11. They had a reservation at a hotel in Mackinaw City but never showed up. Instead, they were entombed in snow on a remote used road with eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies purchased from relatives and a bag of cheese puffs, Marker said. ‘They thought the road was plowed but it wasn't,’ he said. There is no cellphone service in the area. The car eventually lost power, too. Roy and Wright wore layers of clothes to stay warm as overnight temperatures fell to the 20s, and they also turned snow into water. ‘They heard crunching in the woods at night,’ Marker said. ‘They thought it was rescuers but no one came. Then they thought it was bears.’ When the search began, police said the women had told others about possibly visiting waterfalls and casinos on their way to the Lower Peninsula. Their Ford Explorer was spotted from a helicopter around 2.30pm, police said. About 25 minutes later, police officers who were called to the scene reached the car on foot. 'When we pulled up, they grabbed their purses and Lee Wright clutched onto her Bible and both women were very happy,' Marker told MLive.com. 'It was hugs all around.' Road trip: Roy (left), 52, and Wright (right), 56, had been visiting relatives in Ishpeming, Michigan, when on April 11 their Ford Explorer got trapped in snow on a little-used road . Life savers: The women survived by rationing eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies, a bag of cheese puffs and melted snow . The women were transported to Helen Newberry Joy Hospital to be checked by doctors. A photo of Roy and Wright showed them eating food and keeping warm in state police coats after the rescue. ‘They're walking. ... They're alive and well, just a little weak from being stuck for a couple weeks,’ said Sgt. Brent Rosten, of the Michigan State Police. The women's relatives were ecstatic to receive the good news Friday. 'My mom and Aunt Leslie have been found, and they are alive and well, thank God!' Wright's daughter, Stacy Calvin-Lowe, wrote on Facebook Friday. 'Everyone that help us search, everyone that prayed, everyone that supported us, from the depths of my heart, thank you! 'I am so thankful, and overwhelmed with joy, I can't stop crying! I can't wait to see my momma, I can't wait to tell her I love her!! I am incredibly happy!'", "reference_summary": "Leslie Roy, 52, and Lee Wright, 56, had been visiting relatives in Michigan when on April 11 their Ford Explorer got trapped in snow on remote road .

Thousands of cars aged three to eight years old were assessed on their failure rate, age, mileage and cost of repairs. The most reliable was Honda, with Suzuki second and Toyota in third place while Chevrolet and Mazda were joint fourth. Overall, the most reliable models were the Honda Jazz and Mitsubishi Lancer while the least reliable was the Audi RS6, which was also the most costly to fix, with an average repair bill of £1,003. Electrical faults were the most common across all cars, accounting for almost a quarter of visits to garages. Axle and suspension faults were also common, affecting 22% of cars. What Car? magazine compiled the table with the Warranty Direct website. What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'Honda's success in the reliability index is chiefly down to low failure rates. But, when things do go wrong, the cars are also relatively cheap to fix. 'Reliability is always one of the key attributes buyers look for when considering a used car purchase, so manufacturers that consistently demonstrate durability will always do well with the consumer.' The list price of Bentleys ranges from £136,250 to £224,700.", "reference_summary": "Bentleys and Porsches finished bottom of reliability table of manufacturers .

Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we’d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we’re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £200. They said: 'We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there’s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about £10,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I’ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for £100 each. But it’s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £40 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between £100 and £200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum’s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick — Andy Warhol’s muse — I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £20 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds.

In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it.

Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s.

Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced.

My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory.

The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring.

Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors.

We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields.

Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there’s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we’d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I’ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we’re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for £295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work — we spent nearly £200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone £250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn’t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost £400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country — the most we’ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year’s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for £200. They said: 'We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around £45,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It’s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we’re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: ‘Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?’ We’re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost £200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We’ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We’ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It’s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I’ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s — they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there’s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we’ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn’t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it’s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it’s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about £10,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I’ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for £100 each. But it’s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for £40 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves — they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can’t help but buy it — at one point I owned six. I’ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between £100 and £200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it’s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn’t want my house to look like everyone else’s — that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum’s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick — Andy Warhol’s muse — I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about £20 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at £100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost £5 from a charity shop — I don’t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don’t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I’ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn’t fit in my kitchen so I’ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that’s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits.

Wedding season is upon us and for brides on a budget, there's plenty of ways to save thousands of pounds on your special day . 1. GO BIG: Rather than having lots of smaller tables, seat your guests on larger tables. Not only will they get to know more people, you'll save money by having to purchases fewer centerpieces and tablecloths. 2. SAVVY SHOPPING: When seeking decor, shop out of season. Black vases will be on sale after Halloween, red and gold after Christmas and pink after Valentine's Day. Also, money saving sites such as Groupon actually offer entire wedding day packages occasionally. 3. CUT ON BAR COSTS: Not only will an open bar end up in a rather messy evening, it will also leave a dent in your bank account.

Huge pasta dishes, massive salads and big rice bowls will not only cut costs but also serve as an icebreaker and act as a centerpiece. 14.

Moore has been on the run from the law for more than four decades, until Monday afternoon when he called the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Kentucky and admitted to being a fugitive. Sheriff Pat Melton says Moore, 66, was at the former Polk Youth Institute in Butner, North Carolina, serving a sentence of more than 10 years for larceny when he broke free June 10, 1972. Scroll down for video . Captured: Clarence David Moore, 66, is seen being wheeled from his home in Frankfort, Kentucky, Monday, after he admitted to being a fugitive who escaped from a North Carolina prison in 1972 . Medical necessity: Moore suffers from several medical conditions and cannot walk, but because he has no Social Security card of any form of ID, he has been unable to receive medical treatment . At 4pm Monday, nearly 43 years after Moore’s escape, he finally emerged from the shadows. ‘I need to make this right and get through this,’ Moore was quoted as telling Sheriff Melton. After sheriff's deputies verified Moore's story, he was taken into custody. The 66-year-old, who suffers from several unspecified ailments and apparently cannot walk on his own, was captured by the station WTVQ being wheeled out of his Frankfort home on a gurney and taken to a hospital before being sent to jail. He explained to investigators he has not been able to get medical treatment because he does not have a Social Security card or any other form of identification. According to the sheriff's office, the man’s unexpected decision to give himself up after all these years was motivated by his desire to see a doctor. Now it will be up to prosecutors in North Carolina to decide whether to pursue extradition in Moore's case.

The Warriors came out on top 12-4 in a brutal, no-holds-barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the DW Stadium which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest. Defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing Good Friday duel as the ferocious exchanges, on a glue-pot pitch, began to takes its toll. Wigan Warriors' Dom Manfredi (centre) celebrates with his team-mates after he scores his side's first try. It took a try from Sydney-bound winger Joe Burgess 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions' resistance. It was a second successive defeat for Saints, who began the season under Keiron Cunningham with six wins in a row, but there was no shame in this loss. Cunningham was forced to turn to a new half-back pairing in Jordan Turner and Lance Hohaia after skipper Jon Wilkin joined Travis Burns on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while Paul Wellens, restored to the captaincy, limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle, . Wigan could hardly have made a better start, with winger Dom Manfredi charging over for a try after just 52 seconds, reclaiming possession after Turner's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop Lee Mossop. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over St Helens . Matty Smith kicked the goal to make it 6-0 and Saints had to scramble to prevent Manfredi and his centre Anthony Gelling adding to the Warriors' lead. Wigan were indebted to a terrific last-ditch by George Williams that brought down centre Josh Jones in full flight and, as the momentum shifted towards the visitors, it was no surprise when impressive forward Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook charged over for a try on 15 minutes. Tom Makinson, third choice marskman in the absence of Mark Percival and Burns, was unable to add the goal and Saints suffered a blow when boom second rower Joe Greenwood, just back from an elbow injury, limped off with an ankle problem. As the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in, the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between. Wigan Warriors' Manfredi (centre) is tackled by St Helens' Josh Jones (left) and James Roby . The impressive Manfredi was hauled down just short of the line while Saints loose forward Luke Thompson went close for the visitors. The key moment came 10 minutes from the end when Saints turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by Wigan's tigerish tackling. Wigan substitute prop Ryan Sutton was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when Burgess won the race to George Williams' grubber kick, touching the ball down with inches to spare.

One of the most useful pieces of equipment that I take absolutely everywhere is my head torch - it's gotten me out of a tight spot on more than one occasion.

This increases the risk of epilepsy, autism and breast cancer. Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30, and the researchers say older would-be fathers should be better informed about the risks of conditions that can occur in their offspring. Whereas the menopause marks the end of reproduction, men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and, according to the new research from doctors at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, and other centres, this could have implications for the next generation. Men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and this could have implications for the next generation . Worldwide data from more than 60 teams of researchers on the health risks associated with older fathers found that men aged over 35 had a 50 per cent lower chance of conceiving over a 12-month period than men 25 and under, even after taking into account the age of the would-be mother. The risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rises when the man is more than 40. A study of 23,821 pregnant women analysed by the researchers found that pregnancies involving men aged 50 or older were twice as likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger fathers. And the problems may not end with conception. Advanced paternal age (over 40) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent, according to one of the studies the American researchers looked at (one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer). Children conceived by fathers over 40 also have a 30 per cent increased risk of epilepsy, a 37 per cent higher risk of Down's syndrome, a 14 per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia, and a 70 per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancers (such as brain tumours). If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer. Older fathers are thought to be at higher risk of having children with autism and schizophrenia. If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer . Some of the biggest increases in risk are seen in genetic disorders. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is nearly eight times more prevalent in the children of fathers aged 50 and over. So, why might this be? In order to produce new sperm, so-called sperm 'precursor' cells have to divide. They do this every 16 days, which means by the time a man reaches 70, these cells will have divided around 1,500 times. With each division comes a risk of DNA mutation and genetic defects. A study from Iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 DNA mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually, reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men, increasing the risk of problems. Another explanation is that, after the age of 60, a high percentage of sperm is affected by so-called DNA fragmentation. Normally, the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strands of DNA breaking. When the genetic material is not safely packaged, the DNA strands are vulnerable to breakage, or DNA fragmentation, which means the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and, in some cases, become unviable. With age, a man's testosterone levels also drop, with one in five men over 60 having low levels, leading to poor semen quality, which can affect conception rates. Advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects, say the Baylor researchers, whose study is being published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr Simon Fishel, chief executive of CARE Fertility, says: 'Even though men keep producing sperm, the decline in sperm DNA with age is now uncontroversial, with potentially devastating effects on the offspring of older men. 'It is not as marked or obvious an effect that we observe in women, which makes it all the more insidious and risky for populations in which men are reproducing later in life. 'This study is telling us we need to sit up and take note, and start to educate the public on the risks of the male biological clock, and not just the female.' Women are generally counselled that as they reach their late-30s, their risk of not just conceiving, but of having a healthy child decreases as the quality and quantity of their eggs deteriorate. At 35, a woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down's syndrome is about one in 350, but by age 45, it is about one in 30. Yet currently, patients are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risks to their offspring, but this should change, says Dr Dolores Lamb, director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Professor of Urology and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. 'The medical community must do a better job of educating couples that there are some risks associated with conception at advanced paternal age,' she says.

Yet currently, patients are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risks to their offspring, but this should change, says Dr Dolores Lamb, director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Professor of Urology and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. 'The medical community must do a better job of educating couples that there are some risks associated with conception at advanced paternal age,' she says.

This increases the risk of epilepsy, autism and breast cancer. Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30, and the researchers say older would-be fathers should be better informed about the risks of conditions that can occur in their offspring. Whereas the menopause marks the end of reproduction, men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and, according to the new research from doctors at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, and other centres, this could have implications for the next generation. Men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and this could have implications for the next generation . Worldwide data from more than 60 teams of researchers on the health risks associated with older fathers found that men aged over 35 had a 50 per cent lower chance of conceiving over a 12-month period than men 25 and under, even after taking into account the age of the would-be mother. The risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rises when the man is more than 40. A study of 23,821 pregnant women analysed by the researchers found that pregnancies involving men aged 50 or older were twice as likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger fathers. And the problems may not end with conception. Advanced paternal age (over 40) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent, according to one of the studies the American researchers looked at (one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer). Children conceived by fathers over 40 also have a 30 per cent increased risk of epilepsy, a 37 per cent higher risk of Down's syndrome, a 14 per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia, and a 70 per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancers (such as brain tumours). If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer. Older fathers are thought to be at higher risk of having children with autism and schizophrenia. If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer . Some of the biggest increases in risk are seen in genetic disorders. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is nearly eight times more prevalent in the children of fathers aged 50 and over. So, why might this be? In order to produce new sperm, so-called sperm 'precursor' cells have to divide. They do this every 16 days, which means by the time a man reaches 70, these cells will have divided around 1,500 times. With each division comes a risk of DNA mutation and genetic defects. A study from Iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 DNA mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually, reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men, increasing the risk of problems. Another explanation is that, after the age of 60, a high percentage of sperm is affected by so-called DNA fragmentation. Normally, the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strands of DNA breaking. When the genetic material is not safely packaged, the DNA strands are vulnerable to breakage, or DNA fragmentation, which means the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and, in some cases, become unviable. With age, a man's testosterone levels also drop, with one in five men over 60 having low levels, leading to poor semen quality, which can affect conception rates. Advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects, say the Baylor researchers, whose study is being published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr Simon Fishel, chief executive of CARE Fertility, says: 'Even though men keep producing sperm, the decline in sperm DNA with age is now uncontroversial, with potentially devastating effects on the offspring of older men. 'It is not as marked or obvious an effect that we observe in women, which makes it all the more insidious and risky for populations in which men are reproducing later in life. 'This study is telling us we need to sit up and take note, and start to educate the public on the risks of the male biological clock, and not just the female.'

The accompanying video is guaranteed to be the most awesome thing you see today. In it, fellow scientist Brian Cox rails against the inaccuracies in \"Galaxy Song\" when a fed-up Hawking, who has ALS, zooms up in his wheelchair and knocks over Cox. Hawking continues singing the song in his signature computerized voice. Hawking then launches into the stratosphere for a trippy ride and lesson on the cosmos. The scene is derived from a filmed bit that Monty Python uses during its live shows. 40 years of 'Holy Grail': The best of Monty Python . \"Galaxy Song\" song was written by Python member Eric Idle, along with John Du Prez, and is \"an intricate and informative lecture on the enor-mity of the Universe fashioned into a bewitching and, above all, highly amusing pop song,\" according to the comedy troupe's site. Hawking's version is available for download. It's not Hawking's first music gig; he's also featured on the Pink Floyd song \"Talkin' Hawkin.'\" The original version of \"Galaxy Song\" is below. A sampling of the lyrics: \"Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving and revolving at 900 miles an hour. That's orbiting at 19 miles a second so it's reckoned.

Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns. The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\" The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.", "reference_summary": "Were the police justified in stopping Freddie Gray?

It's been a successful week for Candice, who recently appeared in Max Factor's latest beauty campaign as none other than silver screen legend Marilyn Monroe. The 26-year-old South African bombshell oozes old Hollywood glamour in the series of shots, which see her don a platinum blonde wig, a crimson pout and a dramatic cat-eye flick. Max Factor, which celebrates its 80th anniversary this year, is the brand widely accredited for transforming Monroe from a mousy brunette to a knockout blonde back in 1935, and delivering her with the iconic look showcased by Candice today. Candice may radiate confidence these days, but this wasn't always the case. In a recent interview with Maxim, the lingerie model admitted it had taken her quite some time to feel comfortable in her skin. Elsa Hosk, 26, also stars in the shoot; the Swedish model has worked for the likes of Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Ungaro, H&M and Guess . Jasmine Tookes, 24, has walked the runway for the likes of Calvin Klein, Tom Ford, Prada, Miu Miu and Versace .

Candice, who has been working almost non-stop since was discovered at the age of 15, said she had to grow up fast. 'In one way I feel much older, because I’ve had to deal with a lot more responsibility and a career and money at an early age,' she said. 'But at the same time, there’s still a 15-year-old girl in me, one who doesn’t even have a driver's license.'

Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns. The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\" The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference.

Speaking at the University of Queensland in Brisbane on Friday night, Justice Diana Bryant told a room full of journalists that surrogacy laws currently in place need a major overhaul to prevent cases of abandonment. She said she believes that because commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia, hopeful parents are forced to enter into unlawful arrangements overseas. Scroll down for video . A top judge in Brisbane has said that surrogacy laws need to be overhauled to prevent a repeat of the baby Gammy (pictured with his mother) case . 'I personally think we should regulate and allow commercial surrogacy in Australia,' she said. 'If we allow it in Australia, we then can regulate it and ensure that it's done on ethical terms.' Her statement is backed up by a recent bout of child abandonment cases, where parents have refused to carry through with overseas surrogacy deals. This week an Australian couple were slammed after they left a baby boy born to their Indian surrogate with his mother after she unexpectedly gave birth to twins. Documents revealed the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. Justice Diana Bryant (pictured) has spoken out about Australia's surrogacy laws . The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. They was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. The Indian case is similar to the controversial baby Gammy scenario. Gammy was born in Thailand to a surrogate mother, however after reportedly learning that he had a disability, his Australian parents, West Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell, only brought his twin sister home with them. The Farnells returned to Australia with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, while Ms Chanbua remained with Gammy in Thailand's Chonburi province. Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender, retained custody of Pipah late last year after an investigation by the WA Department for Child Protection. Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . In November, WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said there would be 'continual and rigorous testing' of a safety plan that had been developed for Pipah. Following these cases the Thai government passed a law criminalising surrogacy and prohibiting foreigners from seeking surrogacy services. The law, which prohibits the act of hiring women commercially to carry foetuses to term, aims to stop Thailand from being a surrogacy hub for foreign couples. Currently in Australia, it is illegal for women to act as surrogates, except in the Northern Territory where there are no laws in place to stop the act. In NSW, ACT and Queensland, arranging a contracted surrogacy overseas is also considered a criminal offence. Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell . 'I think the Government could eliminate some of the worst aspects of international surrogacy by devising some ethical requirements that need to be met before intending parents are permitted to bring a child back into Australia,' Justice Bryant said. Justice Bryant also said Australian surrogacy should be legalised as many of the children who are currently born to surrogates overseas will never get the chance to meet their biological mothers. 'That child is never going to know their biological mother, and in those cases, there is absolutely no opportunity for them ever to find out,' she said. 'The knowing the biological parentage for me would be one of the first steps and I think we have a responsibility as a country to make sure the worse aspects of commercial surrogacy are overcome.'", "reference_summary": "Top judge said Australian commercial surrogacy needs to be legalised .

Although her wealth has increased year-on-year, her assets have been dwarfed by hundreds of financiers and businessmen. Britain’s super-rich are now more than twice as rich as they were in 2009, despite the catastrophic economic crisis. Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday. She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of £340m, compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first time . Len Blavatnick, pictured left with his wife Emily, topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of £13.2bn. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja were pushed into second placed as their wealth was valued at £13bn . 1. Len Blavatnik £13.17billion (Investment, music and media) 2. Sri and Gopi Hinduja: £13billion (Industry and finance) 3. Galena and George Weston and family: £11billion (Retailing) 4. Alisher Usmanov: £9.8billion (Mining and investment) 5. David and Simon Reubeb: £9.7billion (Property and internet) Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £547billion, up from £258billion in 2009, an increase of 112 per cent. Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £100million – £45million more than in 2009 and £15million more than last year, the biggest annual leap in 18 years. The findings are revealed in this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, which consists of people who are British, who live and work in the UK, or who have ‘strong links’ to this country. The Queen’s wealth grew modestly in the last year by £10million to £340million, leaving her at number 302 – down from 285 in 2014. Almost three decades ago, when the list was first compiled, the Queen was placed at the top, with £5.2billion. However, the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection, which could not be described as her personal wealth. Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14, with profits of £267million. Under new financing rules, the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant. Lord Alan Sugar is a billionaire for the first time, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, while JK Rowling continues to earn from the Harry Potter franchise as well as her adult bestseller The Casual Vacancy . George Clooney's marriage to human rights lawyer Amal means the couple's wealth also features at no. 790 . Roman Abramovich, the seventh wealthiest person in the UK according to the Rich List (right) speaks to Jose Mourinho, manager of Chelsea FC which he owns. Abramovich made his wealth through oil and industry . Among the new entries are Hollywood actor George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal, who married in September. Worth an estimated £121million, the pair are listed at number 790 above a number of super-wealthy businessmen and aristocrats. Other celebrities on the list include David and Victoria Beckham, as their joint wealth increases to £240million thanks to his sponsorship deals with Adidas and H&M. The footballer, 39, is now one of the country’s leading philanthropists, with his latest project, 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund, aiming to raise £7million for needy children in the next three years. Apprentice star Alan Sugar is now a billionaire for the first time, after his wealth increased by £140million to £1.04billion. Blavatnik, pictured with singer Katherine Jenkins . Len Blavatnik, a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine, tops this year’s Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £13.17billion. The 57-year-old built much of his fortune, which is up £3.17billion on 2014, from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP, but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone, the Beatles’ label, to his growing number of interests. The son of two Jewish academics, he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984. Two years later, he started an investment company, Access Industries, and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK, partner of BP. When TNK-BP was sold in 2013, Blavatnik’s share was more than £4billion. Access’s stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow. Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife, Emily Appelson. At his 50th birthday party, she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet. He owns a £41million mansion in London’s Kensington, recently paid $77million (£50.7million) for a five-bedroom duplex in New York, and has donated £75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government. Blavatnik’s ten quoted and private company stakes are worth £9billion. With £3billion of cash, £440million of property and other assets, he is worth £13.17billion. He may have just missed out on the top 100, but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year. The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his £1.04billion wealth. Lord Sugar, pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton, has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14 . He was described by The Sunday Times as ‘super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down’ on The Apprentice. The BBC show first ran in 2005, with winners including Leah Totton, who triumphed in 2013, securing Lord Sugar’s backing to open a cosmetic clinic. Lord Sugar has £700million of real estate, while net profits for Amshold, his holding company, soared to £552m in 2013-14. There are now 117 sterling billionaires based in Britain, up 12 per cent on last year, but only 62 are British – including Sir Richard Branson, Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley and Sir James Dyson. At the top of Britain’s cash pile is Ukraine-born Len Blavatnik, who has investments in music, industry and media, and is worth £13.17billion, up £3.17billion on 2014. A Briton on the average annual wage of £25,000 would need to work for 526,800 years to earn the same. At number two are India-born brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who have family interests in industry and global finance and are worth £13billion. The Anglo-Canadian Weston family, who own Primark as well as Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason in London, are third with £11billion. David and Victoria Beckham, worth £240million .

Injury-depleted United slipped to defeat despite enjoying the better of much of the play against the Premier League leaders, who are now 11 points clear of the third-placed Red Devils. Yet the visitors' performance at Stamford Bridge on Saturday has given Rooney and Van Gaal cause for optimism. United ace Wayne Rooney was happy with his side's display at Stamford Bridge despite the negative result . Louis van Gaal labelled his side's performance against rivals Chelsea as their best display of the season . 'I thought it was excellent, we dominated from start to finish,' Rooney told MUTV. 'We created some good chances, but unfortunately didn't take any of them. 'I felt that if we got a goal, even with five minutes to go, we would have gone on to win. 'We can take great confidence from this result as I've rarely seen a team come to Stamford Bridge and dominate so much, all that was missing was a goal. 'On another day we could have scored two or three goals, but it wasn't to be. 'We have to move on now and look forward to facing Everton next weekend.' Van Gaal, who deployed Rooney in midfield after injuries to Michael Carrick, among others, was pleased with the chances created, but rued missing them. 'We were always in the half of the opponent,' the Dutchman said. 'In spite of the compact defence and the defensive organisation of Chelsea, we have created in the second half more chances. 'That is an unbelievable performance, I think. But you need to score. 'Normally we are more effective. I think we played a fantastic match, but we lost.'

An example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy. Among the feel-good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap. Reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed. You cannot reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best-buy at Morrison’s. Experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones, enjoying warm weather, eating wonderful home-cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably. It’s not rocket science. Surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy. Here’s my list of pet hates — which gets longer by the day: . In the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy, Janet Street-Porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day! TRENDY MEN WITH BUSHY BEARDS . Is there anything less attractive than a man’s chin covered by a thick mat of hair? God forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a Sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of Moses. SECRET FACE-LIFTS . Every September, I encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut, whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes. Although they put this good health down to a ‘wonderfully restful holiday’, the truth is they’ve had a face-lift. NASTY LITTLE SACHETS . The bane of B&Bs, cafes and hotels. What’s wrong with a pot of jam on the table? WEATHER DOLLIES . Every night these simpering females appear on local TV news bulletins, posing pertly in front of a map of Britain in very high heels, and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks, waving perfectly manicured hands around. VOUCHERS PAST USE-BY DATES . As a dedicated bargain-hunter, it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully-collected discount vouchers have expired. Janet is a self-confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date . ANYTHING CALLED ‘AN EXPERIENCE’ Shopping has become a pastime, like making raffia mats or embroidery, and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘experience’. Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash? This drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in Boots. Janet remains baffled by pay-by-phone car parking, what's wrong with cash? QUEUE-JUMPERS AT AIRPORTS . After patiently waiting my turn, I could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘friend’ in the queue in front on me. SUPERFOODS . Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of ‘de-planing’ (don’t they mean ‘disembarking’ or ‘getting off’)? Railway stations are described as ‘calling points’. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians ‘jubilating’ after the country’s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘stake-holders’. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the ‘re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: ‘It doesn’t work!’ ‘Re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil’s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it’s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly. Being confronted by an embarrassed 16-year-old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining!", "reference_summary": "An increasing number of surveys claim to reveal what makes us happiest .

An example of this banality last week was one about what makes us most happy. Among the feel-good experiences were said to be fresh sheets and popping bubble wrap. Reading this idiotic list made me extremely depressed. You cannot reduce life to a catchphrase or a ranking like a best-buy at Morrison’s. Experiences which bring us true pleasure are being with loved ones, enjoying warm weather, eating wonderful home-cooked food and just laughing uncontrollably. It’s not rocket science. Surely a far more useful exercise is to list every aspect of modern life that makes us unhappy. Here’s my list of pet hates — which gets longer by the day: . In the face of an increasing number of surveys claiming to reveal what makes us most happy, Janet Street-Porter reveals her list of the things that are making her unhappy - which is getting longer by the day! TRENDY MEN WITH BUSHY BEARDS . Is there anything less attractive than a man’s chin covered by a thick mat of hair? God forbid you get close enough to snog anyone sprouting a beard that makes them look like a Sixties folk singer or an extra from a remake of Moses. SECRET FACE-LIFTS . Every September, I encounter women whose faces look suspiciously taut, whose saggy chins have vanished and who have managed to eradicate the bags under their eyes. Although they put this good health down to a ‘wonderfully restful holiday’, the truth is they’ve had a face-lift. NASTY LITTLE SACHETS . The bane of B&Bs, cafes and hotels. What’s wrong with a pot of jam on the table? WEATHER DOLLIES . Every night these simpering females appear on local TV news bulletins, posing pertly in front of a map of Britain in very high heels, and totally inappropriate cocktail frocks, waving perfectly manicured hands around. VOUCHERS PAST USE-BY DATES . As a dedicated bargain-hunter, it causes deep pain to discover at the till that my carefully-collected discount vouchers have expired. Janet is a self-confessed bargain hunter who hates it when she discovers her vouchers are out of date . ANYTHING CALLED ‘AN EXPERIENCE’ Shopping has become a pastime, like making raffia mats or embroidery, and addicts dignify this mindless activity by talking about the ‘experience’. Everything is an ‘experience’ these days, from a car wash to munching on a burger. SLUGS, SNAILS, MICE . Is there anything more soul-destroying than lovingly nurturing broad beans, peas and lettuces from seed, only to go away for the weekend and return to find they have been destroyed by these vile creatures. DIETING CELEBRITIES . Nothing makes me crosser than celebrities’ claims that any weight-loss is due to ‘eating healthily’. Nine times out of ten, they’ve been paid a huge sum of money to plug a diet plan or a food supplement. CHEFS WHO THINK THEY’RE PICASSO . Too many chefs fiddle with a decent meal and turn it into something that artist Tracey Emin would be proud of. For example, with chive and parmesan crisps carefully balanced like a propeller surrounded by drips of gravy. Yuk. PAY-BY-PHONE CAR PARKING . What’s wrong with cash? This drives people crazy — especially older people who find it a big hassle to try to use a phone to pay for 20 minutes in a car park so you can get your shopping in Boots. Janet remains baffled by pay-by-phone car parking, what's wrong with cash? QUEUE-JUMPERS AT AIRPORTS . After patiently waiting my turn, I could murder anyone who suddenly appears out of the blue and joins a ‘friend’ in the queue in front on me. SUPERFOODS . Sold at a premium price because we are so desperate to extend our lives by a month, that we want to stuff ourselves with goji berries, quinoa, purple sprouting broccoli, pink tomatoes and hideous kale. Funny how mum and dad were so thin and fit, without a single goji berry. FAKE WORDS . For example, air stewards talk of ‘de-planing’ (don’t they mean ‘disembarking’ or ‘getting off’)? Railway stations are described as ‘calling points’. I heard a radio reporter speak about Nigerians ‘jubilating’ after the country’s recent election. Phoney words started when ordinary people started being called ‘stake-holders’. I blame New Labour. RE-SEALABLE BAGS OF RICE . Whoever invented the ‘re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta etc, I want to go around to their house and shout: ‘It doesn’t work!’ ‘Re-sealable’ bag for rice, nuts, pasta just don't make sense to Janet . JUICERS . The Devil’s gadgets. If God had meant us to live on green slime, he would have given us gills and no teeth. Part of the enjoyment of food is the textures and fibres. No one is going to reduce my breakfast to slurry in the name of an energy drink. MIRACLE FACE/EYE CREAM . The impossible dream — turning back time with a pot of gunk. Only a giant pleat pulled together at the back of my neck will get rid of the sagging jowls on my jawline. The cheapest solution is to talk a lot, so the loose flesh keeps moving and it either tightens up or it’s not so obvious. PAYING BILLS ONLINE . Having to remember all the ruddy passwords to log on to your account takes longer than writing an old-fashioned cheque and sticking it in an envelope. SMALL TALK . I’m useless at this, and am infuriated when check-out staff in the supermarket (ordered to do so by their boss) ask how I am. If wanted to talk to them, I’d open the conversation. TRAD JAZZ . In my mind, this will for ever be ‘dad’ jazz, not helped by the fact Tory grandee Ken Clarke is a huge fan. Modern jazz is fantastic, but I’m afraid the late clarintettist Acker Bilk has a lot to answer for. Trad jazz goes with halitosis, corduroy trousers, a check shirt and a dodgy waistcoat. YORKSHIRE PUD FLOPS . I am a decent cook, but I’ve never managed to make a Yorkshire pud that didn’t resemble an old shoe sole. And don’t bother writing in with your tips, I’ve tried them all. Limp and lifeless Yorkshire puddings are also something that Janet's added to her list of annoyances . GETTING MY NAME WRONG . Don’t ever call me Janice! In America, I’m routinely called Miss Street or Mrs Porter. Sorry, I managed to marry a double-barrelled bloke, but that’s my name, so get over it. ORIGAMI HOTEL TOWELS . Is this a substitute for real cleaning — folding the ends of toilet paper into points and sticking the clean towels on the bed, turned into origami swans? CENTRAL HEATING CONTROLS . When the Devil wanted to create something that would result in regular domestic fury, he devised the control box for programming central heating. Holiday settings, off-peak settings and then copying each day’s setting to the next day … I feel miserable just thinking about it. COUNTRY PUB LANDLORDS . As a walker, I know that the more remote the pub, the less likely it will serve anything edible after 2pm. They think they can fob people off with a bag of crisps and a picked onion. Forget the ‘hospitality industry’, it’s more like the hostility industry. Traditional pubs often seem to have landlords who think they can fob you off with just a bag of crisps, according to Janet (stock image) UNNECESSARY INSURANCE . I am bombarded with leaflets and emails offering special insurance for my gutters, my roof, the central heating, the drains, the pipework, the pet, and my holidays. How did we get through life before the advent of insurance? I have cancelled nearly all the policies after my plumber told me one for the boiler costing me £200 a year was pointless. MEN AND SHOPPING LISTS . What is it about men and supermarkets? Why do they have to go off-piste? Instead of getting the essentials you’ve carefully written down for them, they buy their own favourites: a nasty can of hot dogs, a huge pot of English mustard and a jumbo bag of crisps. STEPS AT STATIONS . Maybe it’s because I make a lot of journeys with a heavy wheelie bag stuffed full of left-overs from the fridge, my computer, some clean clothes and a book. But why do most railway stations have giant flights of steps between platforms and up from the car park? READY-TO-EAT FRUIT . Another supermarket scam —you pay way more for this stuff on the basis that it will be deliciously ripe, but they invariably turn to mush in 24 hours. BABY CHAT . Ok, I haven’t had a baby, only four husbands — but I don’t go around flashing photos of them at people. Why should I be interested in someone’s new baby, unless they are directly related to me? Most babies look exactly the same anyway, just giant tadpoles in nappies. Janet can't stand it when people go around flashing pictures of their new-born children (stock image) PUBLIC EATING . We’ve become a nation of scoffers totally unembarrassed about gorging while we walk, dropping chips and spraying crumbs as we chat on our mobile phones. Ugh! TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENTS . Every journey nowadays seems to be blighted by the guard (now called a ‘train manager’!) making endless useless announcements about the next station, the cause of a delay or the availability of a full range of snacks (i.e. just crisps) in the buffet car (now re-named the ‘on-board café’.) TOILET ROLL TROLLS . There’s nothing more annoying than someone who doesn’t replace a toilet roll. BAD IMPERSONATORS OF ME . About once a month, a member of the public comes up to me and announces that their teenage daughter does a really good impersonation of me and is thinking of a career on telly. Being confronted by an embarrassed 16-year-old with ginger hair attempting to mimic my accent is not remotely entertaining!", "reference_summary": "An increasing number of surveys claim to reveal what makes us happiest .

Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani.

Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left a memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat in 2010. The memo, found by his Liberal Democrat successor David Laws, said: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid that there is no money. Kind regards and good luck.' Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today finally got round to sending a letter to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy'. It said: 'The deficit halved. Jobs up. Growth up. That's the Liberal Democrat record,' he wrote. 'We won't let you – or the Tories – screw it up!' Scroll down for video . Danny Alexander tweeted a picture of himself with his response to the infamous note left in the Treasury by his Labour predecessor Liam Byrne, saying there was 'no money' left . Mr Alexander, the present Chief Secretary, today sent a letter (left) to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply to his original note (right) – saying it was because he had been 'fixing the economy' The original note has haunted Labour since it was first published in the days after Coalition was formed in 2010. Ed Balls sparked a furious response from David Cameron earlier this month after he dismissed the letter as a 'jokey note'. The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by Mr Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is joined by his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez at The Devonshire Arms in Sheffield today . The Deputy Prime Minister is hoping his message that the Lib Dems can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party's dire position in the polls . He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Liam Byrne, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown, left the original memo on his desk after Labour's election defeat . Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' The Prime Minister said Mr Balls's response was 'frankly the most appalling thing I have heard in this election campaign so far'. He claimed Balls was Ed Miliband's third choice to be shadow chancellor and was frankly 'the country's last choice to be put in charge of this nation's finances'. He said: 'The note that was left was correct. It said there was no money left. Let us think about the consequences of what we inherited and what we had to do. We had to make difficult decisions, we had to find efficiencies in government spending, we had to put up some taxes. 'We had to make some very very difficult decisions to get this country back on track. That note that said there is no money left was referring to the fact that our budget deficit was forecast to be bigger than the budget deficit in Greece when I became prime minister.'", "reference_summary": "Labour's Liam Byrne left a memo for the incoming Coalition government .

The Magpies slumped to a sixth straight defeat at home to Spurs last weekend amid an atmosphere of unrest after thousands of supporters boycotted the match in protest at a lack of ambition and investment from owner Mike Ashley. Fans group AshleyOut.com are now encouraging supporters to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ when Swansea visit St James’ Park on Saturday. This will involve a 34th-minute protest in recognition of the £34million which was last week revealed to be sitting in the club’s bank. Newcastle interim manager John Carver has called for unity at the club following a divisive season . Carver has said he is not afraid about giving his honest opinion on events at St James' Park . And Carver said: ‘We have to find a way of dealing with it and managing the situation because it can only hurt us – that is the fans and the club. ‘We need to find a solution. I don’t know what that is and I haven’t had talks about it, but if I get asked my opinion then I would give an honest answer. ‘It would be fantastic (if this was resolved ahead of next season). From day one it would be better. That is what we need to do.’ Carver, meanwhile, says his players were affected by the protest during the 3-1 loss against Spurs. ‘When I came away from the game I thought about it and the people who were in the stadium weren’t quite sure how to react. Some of them were annoyed that people had stayed away, others were delighted. It was strange,’ he said. ‘When it all kicked off last year you knew where you stood. This wasn’t a nice situation to be in, it was uncomfortable. ‘There was a lot of apprehension around the place on Sunday. I hear there was anger with each other and people falling out with each other in the stands. That cannot help, surely not. ‘I thought it didn’t affect us during the game, but on reflection I think it did.’ Carver – who is likely to be replaced by Steve McClaren in the summer - says he has not been told if he will still have a role at the club next season. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . However, he hopes that the club make a swift announcement on the future of the managerial position. ‘That would be for everyone’s benefit,’ said Carver when asked if the week after the season’s end was the best time to resolve the current uncertainty. ‘The fans, myself, everyone could enjoy their summer. I think it will be (sorted quickly) because don’t forget the window opens very soon after the season finishes. It has to be done and your recruitment has to be done in that period of time.’ He added: ‘I don’t know (if it will be me). I think people understand the situation I’m in and know what I’m trying to do. ‘Only they (hierarchy) know. But every time I get together with them they are positive – whether that’s to keep me going or they have someone else lined up, I don’t know. ‘That doesn’t affect me, the future will take care of itself. I’m just concentrating on now.’ The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's match against Swansea .
